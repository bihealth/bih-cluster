# How-To: Use Matlab

!!! note
    This information is outdated and will soon be removed. 

!!! note "GNU Octave as Matlab alternative"
    Note that [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is an Open Source alternative to Matlab.
    While both packages are not 100% compatible, Octave is an alternative that does not require any license management.
    Further, you can [easily install it yourself using Conda](../../best-practice/software-installation-with-conda.md).

!!! question "Want to use the Matlab GUI?"
    Make sure you understand X forwarding as outline [in this FAQ entry](../../help/faq.md#how-can-i-access-graphical-user-interfaces-such-as-for-matlab-on-the-cluster).

    You can also use [Open OnDemand Portal](../../ondemand/overview.md) to run Matlab.

## Pre-requisites

You have to register with [hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de](mailto:hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de) for requesting access to the Matlab licenses.
Afterwards, you can connect to the High-Memory using the `license_matlab_r2016b` resource (see below).

## How-To Use

BIH has a license of Matlab R2016b for **16 seats** and various licensed packages (see below).
To display the available licenses:

```bash
login-1:~$ scontrol show lic
LicenseName=matlab_r2016b
    Total=16 Used=0 Free=16 Remote=no
```

Matlab is installed on all of the compute nodes:

```console
# The following is VITAL so the scheduler allocates a license to your session.
login-1:~$ srun -L matlab_r2016b:1 --pty bash -i
med0127:~$ scontrol show lic
LicenseName=matlab_r2016b
    Total=16 Used=1 Free=15 Remote=no
med0127:~$ module avail

## Running MATLAB UI

For starting the Matlab with GUI, make sure that your client is running a X11 server and you connect with X11 forwarding enabled (e.g., `ssh -X hpc-login-1.cubi.bihealth.org` from the Linux command line).
Then, make sure to use `srun -L matlab_r2016b:1 --pty --x11 bash -i` for connecting to a node with X11 forwarding enabled.

```bash
client:~$ ssh -X hpc-login-1.cubi.bihealth.org
[...]
res-login-1:~ $ srun -L matlab_r2016b:1 --pty --x11 bash -i
[...]
med0203:~$ module load matlab/r2016b-0
Start matlab without GUI: matlab -nosplash -nodisplay -nojvm
    Start matlab with GUI (requires X forwarding (ssh -X)): matlab
med0203:~$ matlab
[UI will start]
```

For forcing starting in text mode can be done (as said after `module load`): `matlab -nosplash -nodisplay -nojvm`.

Also see [this FAQ entry](../../help/faq.md#how-can-i-access-graphical-user-interfaces-such-as-for-matlab-on-the-cluster).

## See Available Matlab Licenses

You can use `scontrol show lic` to see the currently available MATLAB license.
E.g., here I am running an interactive shell in which I have requested 1 of the 16 MATLAB licenses, so 15 more remain.

```
$ scontrol show lic
LicenseName=matlab_r2016b
    Total=16 Used=1 Free=15 Remote=no
```

## A Working Example

Get a checkout of our MATLAB example.
Then, look around at the contents of this repository.

```console
res-login-1:~$ git clone https://github.com/bihealth/bih-cluster-matlab-example.git
res-login-1:~$ cd bih-cluster-matlab-example
res-login-1:~$ cat job_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Logging goes to directory sge_log
#SBATCH -o slurm_log/%x-%J.log
# Keep current environment variables
#SBATCH --export=ALL
# Name of the script
#SBATCH --job-name MATLAB-example
# Allocate 4GB of RAM per core
#SBATCH --mem 4G
# Maximal running time of 2 hours
#SBATCH --time 02:00:00
# Allocate one Matlab license
#SBATCH -L matlab_r2016b:1

module load matlab/r2016b-0

matlab -r example
$ cat example.m
% Example Hello World script for Matlab.

disp('Hello world!')
disp('Thinking...')

pause(10)

disp(sprintf('The square root of 2 is = %f', sqrt(2)))
exit
```

For submitting the script, you can do the following

```console
res-login-1:~$ sbatch job_script.sh
```

This will submit a job with one Matlab license requested.
If you were to submit 17 of these jobs, then at least one of them would have to wait until all licenses are free.


!!! warning "Matlab License Server"
    Note that there is a Matlab license server running on the server that will check whether 16 or less Matlab sessions are currently running.
    If a Matlab session is running but this is not made known to the scheduler via `-L matlab_r2016b` then this can lead to scripts crashing as not enough licenses are available.
    If this happens to you, double-check that you have specified the license requirements correctly and notify hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de in case of any problems.
    We will try to sort out the situation then.
