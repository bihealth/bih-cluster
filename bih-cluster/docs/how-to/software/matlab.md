# How-To: Use Matlab

We currently do not support running Matlab on the BIH HPC cluster.
Our recommendation for users dependent on running Matlab scripts is to use [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) as an Open Source alternative.
While both packages are not 100% compatible, Octave does not require any license management and can be [easily install using Conda](../../best-practice/software-installation-with-conda.md).
