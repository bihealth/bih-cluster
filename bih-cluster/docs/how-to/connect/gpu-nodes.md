# How-To: Connect to GPU Nodes

The cluster has seven nodes with four Tesla V100 GPUs each: `hpc-gpu-{1..7}` and one node with 10 A40 GPUs: `hpc-gpu-8`.

Connecting to a node with GPUs is easy.
You request one or more GPU cores by adding a generic resources flag to your Slurm job submission via `srun` or `sbatch`.

- `--gres=gpu:tesla:COUNT` will request NVIDIA V100 cores.
- `--gres=gpu:a40:COUNT` will request NVIDIA A40 cores.
- `--gres=gpu:COUNT` will request any available GPU cores.

Your job will be automatically placed in the Slurm `gpu` partition and allocated a number of `COUNT` GPUs.

!!! info
    Fair use rules apply.
    As GPU nodes are a limited resource, excessive use by single users is prohibited and can lead to mitigating actions.
    Be nice and cooperative with other users.
    Tip: `getent passwd USER_NAME` will give you a user's contact details.

!!! warning "Interactive Use of GPU Nodes is Discouraged"

    While interactive computation on the GPU nodes is convenient, it makes it very easy to forget a job after your computation is complete and let it run idle.
    While your job is allocated, it blocks the **allocated** GPUs and other users cannot use them although you might not be actually using them.
    Please prefer batch jobs for your GPU jobs over interactive jobs.

    Furthermore, interactive GPU jobs are currently limited to 24 hours.
    We will monitor the situation and adjust that limit to optimize GPU usage and usability.

    Please also note that allocation of GPUs through Slurm is mandatory, in other words: Using GPUs via SSH sessions is prohibited.
    The scheduler is not aware of manually allocated GPUs and this interferes with other users' jobs.

## Usage example
### Preparation
We will setup a miniforge installation with `pytorch` testing the GPU.
If you already have this setup then you can skip this step

```bash
hpc-login-1:~$ srun --pty bash
hpc-cpu-1:~$ wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
hpc-cpu-1:~$ bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/work/miniforge
hpc-cpu-1:~$ source ~/work/miniforge/bin/activate
hpc-cpu-1:~$ conda create -y -n gpu-test pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
hpc-cpu-1:~$ conda activate gpu-test
hpc-cpu-1:~$ python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
False
hpc-cpu-1:~$ exit
hpc-login-1:~$
```

The `False` shows that CUDA is not available on the node but that is to be expected.
We're only warming up!

### Allocating GPUs

Let us now allocate a GPU.
The Slurm schedule will properly allocate GPUs for you and setup the environment variable that tell CUDA which devices are available.
The following dry run shows these environment variables (and that they are not available on the login node).

```bash
hpc-login-1:~$ export | grep CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
hpc-login-1:~$ srun --gres=gpu:tesla:1 --pty bash
hpc-gpu-1:~$ export | grep CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
declare -x CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
hpc-gpu-1:~$ exit
hpc-login-1:~$ srun --gres=gpu:tesla:2 --pty bash
hpc-gpu-1:~$ export | grep CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
declare -x CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1"
```

As you see, you can also reserve multiple GPUs.
If we were to open two concurrent connections (e. g. in a `screen`) to the same node when allocating one GPU each, the allocated GPUs would be non-overlapping.
Note that any two jobs are isolated using Linux cgroups ("container" technology) so you cannot accidentally use a GPU of another job.

Now to the somewhat boring part where we show that CUDA actually works.

```bash
hpc-login-1:~$ srun --gres=gpu:tesla:1 --pty bash
hpc-gpu-1:~$ nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2019 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Oct_23_19:24:38_PDT_2019
Cuda compilation tools, release 10.2, V10.2.89
hpc-gpu-1:~$ source ~/work/miniforge/bin/activate
hpc-gpu-1:~$ conda activate gpu-test
hpc-gpu-1:~$ python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
True
```

!!! note
    If scheduling a GPU fails, consider explicitely requesting the GPU partion via
    `--partition gpu` (or `#SBATCH --partition gpu`).

    Also make sure to read the FAQ entry "[I have problems connecting to the GPU node! What's wrong?](../../help/faq.md#i-have-problems-connecting-to-the-gpu-node-whats-wrong)" if you encounter problems.

## Bonus #1: Who is using the GPUs?

Use `squeue` to find out about currently queued jobs (the `egrep` only keeps the header and entries in the `gpu` partition).

```bash
hpc-login-1:~$ squeue | egrep -iw 'JOBID|gpu'
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
                33       gpu     bash holtgrem  R       2:26      1 hpc-gpu-1
```

## Bonus #2: Is the GPU running?

To find out how active the GPU nodes actually are, you can connect to the nodes (without allocating a GPU; you can do this even if the node is full) and then use `nvidia-smi`.

```bash
hpc-login-1:~$ ssh hpc-gpu-1 bash
hpc-gpu-1:~$ nvidia-smi

## Fair Share / Fair Use

**Note that allocating a GPU makes it unavailable for everyone else, so please behave nicely and be cooperative.**
If you see someone blocking the GPU nodes for a long time, first find out who it is.
You can type `getent passwd USER_NAME` on any cluster node to see their email address (and work phone number if added).
Send a friendly email, most likely they blocked the node accidentally.
If you cannot resolve the issue (e. g. the user is not reachable) then please contact hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de.
