## Closing Remarks

We established the HPC Talk forum as a self-help forum for users.
Alas, there is a number of such sites out there already that are populated by more users.

**How does HPC Talk fit in?**

We think it is most useful for asking questions and discussing points that are directly related to the BIH HPC system.

**What alternatives do I have?**

For example:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for general programming questions, including Python/R programming
- [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) for questions regading statistics
- [Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/) for discussing all sorts of Linux/Unix questions
- [Super User](https://superuser.com/) for certain more advanced Unix topics
