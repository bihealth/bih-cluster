## Connecting to the Cluster

You will need to perform some configuration steps after you have been registered with the cluster (via email to hpc-gatekeeper@bihealth.de by a group leader/PI).
Here are the most important points:

1. [Generating SSH Keys :key: in Linux](connecting/generate-key/linux) or [Windows](connecting/generate-key/windows).
2. [Submitting the key :arrow_up: to Charite](connecting/submit-key/charite) or [to MDC](connecting/submit-key/mdc).
3. [Configuring your SSH client :wrench: on Linux and Mac](connecting/configure-ssh/linux) or [Windows](connecting/configure-ssh/windows).
4. Bonus: [Connecting from external networks :flying_saucer:](connecting/from-external).

There are various other topics covered in the "Connecting" section that might be of interest to you.

## Getting Started

To get started, the following is a good reading order after your first successful connection to the cluster.

1. [Getting Help](help/helpdesk) (and [Writing Good Tickets](help/good-tickets)).
2. [For the Impatient](overview/for-the-impatient).
3. [The Cluster Tutorial: First Steps](first-steps/episode-0).

Then, continue reading through the manual.
