Welcome to the user documentation of the BIH high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, also called HPC 4 Research.
The BIH HPC cluster is managed by [CUBI](https://cubi.bihealth.org) (Core Unit Bioinformatics).
This documentation is maintained by BIH CUBI and the user community.
It is a living document that you can update and add to.

The documentation is structured as follows:

- **Administrative** information about administrative processes such as how to get access, register users, work groups, and projects.
- **Connecting** technical help for connecting to the cluster.
- **Storage** describes how and where files are stored.
- **HPC tutorial** a first demo project for getting you started quickly.
- **Cluster Scheduler** technical help for using the Slurm scheduler.
- **OnDemand Portal** introduces web HPC access.
- **Best Practice** guidelines on recommended usage of certain aspects of the system.
- **Static Data (Cubit)** documentation about the static data (files) collection on the cluster.
- **How-To** short(ish) solutions for specific technical problems.
