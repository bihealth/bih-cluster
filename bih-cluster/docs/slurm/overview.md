# Slurm Overview

The "Slurm Scheduler" section assumes that you are already familiar with the HPC clusters in general, the BIH HPC in particular.
For example, you have read the sections

- Overview, starting with [For the Impatient](../overview/for-the-impatient), and
- First Steps/Tutorial, starting with [Episode 0](../first-steps/episode-0).

Thus, the intended audience has already used HPC clusters (or the BIH HPC) a bit and is familiar with the basics of Slurm.
The subsections will walk you through the different aspects of using Slurm.
As we will not be able to capture all aspects, we will link out to other resources on the web.

## A Word on "Elsewhere"

Many facilities run Slurm clusters and have their documentation available on the internet and we will list some that we found useful below.
However, beware that Slurm is a highly configurable and extensible system.
Other sites may have different configurations and plugins enabled than we have (or might even have written custom plugins that are not available at BIH).
In any case, it's always useful to look "Ã¼ber den Tellerrand".

  Beware that their installation is highly customized, in particular partition selection is automatized for them (and it is not for us).
