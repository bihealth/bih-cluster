# Slurm Command: `sacct`

Perform queries to the Slurm accounting information.

!!! info "Representative Example"

    ```bash
    hpc-login-1:~$ sacct -j  1607103
        JobID    JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode
    ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------
    1607103      wgs_sv_an+     medium                     1    PENDING      0:0
    ```

The `sacct` command displays information from the Slurm accounting service.
The Slurm scheduler only knows about active or completing (very recently active) jobs.
The accouting system also knows about currently running jobs so it is the more robust way to query information about jobs.
However, not all information is available to the accouting system, so `scontrol show job` and `squeue` provide more information about current and pending jbos.

## Important Arguments

Also see all important arguments of the [`sbatch`](commands-sbatch.md) command.

- `--jobs`
  -- The job(s) to query for.
- `--format`
  -- Define attributes to retrieve.

## Notes

- If you need to get information about a job regardless of it being in the past, present, or future execution, use `sacct` over `scontrol` and `squeue`.
