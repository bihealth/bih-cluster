# Debugging Connection Problems

When you encounter problems with the login to the cluster although we indicated
that you should have access, depending on the issue, here is a list of how to
solve the problem:

### I'm getting a "connection refused"

The full error message looks as follows:

```
ssh: connect to host hpc-login-1.cubi.bihealth.org port 22: Connection refused
```

This means that your computer could not open a network connection to the server.

- HPC 4 Research can be connected to from:
    - Charite (cabled) network
    - Charite VPN :point_right: **but only with [Zusatzantrag B](/connecting/from-external/#zusatzantrag-b-recommended)**. :point_left:
    - MDC (cabled) network
    - MDC VPN
    - BIH (cabled) network
- If you think that there is no problem with any of this then please include the output of the following command in your ticket (use the server that you want to read instead of `<DEST>`):
    - Linux/Mac
        ```
        ifconfig
        traceroute <DEST>
        ```
    - Windows
        ```
        ipconfig
        tracepath <DEST>
        ```

please write to [hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de](mailto:hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de),
always indicating the message you get and a detailed description of what you
did.
