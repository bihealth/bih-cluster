# Overview

The static data installation can be found at  `/fast/projects/cubit/18.12/static_data`.

The static data directory contains a sub-directory for the genomes, the precomputed index files for several different popular mapping tools and associated annotation (GFF and GTF files) from Ensembl and GENCODE for each of the available genomes.
The top-level directory structure is as follows:

* `static_data/`
    * [`annotations`](annotations.md)
    * [`app_support`](app-support.md)
    * [`db`](databases.md)
    * [`exome_panel`](exomes-panels.md)
    * [`exon_list`](exon-lists.md)
    * [`precomputed`](index-files.md)
    * [`reference`](references.md)
