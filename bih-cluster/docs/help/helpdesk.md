But before contacting the helpdesk, try to get help in the [HPC Talk](../how-to/misc/hpc-talk.md) BIH HPC user self-help forum!

## Helpdesk Scope

Our helpdesk can support you in the following areas:

- Problems/questions with connecting to the clusters.
- Problems/questions  with using the cluster scheduler or operating system.
- Requests for the installation of common software.
- Problems with running your software that works in other environments.

We will try our best to resolve these issues.
Please note that all other questions can only be answered in a "best effort way".

## Helpdesk Non-Scope

The following topics are out of scope for the BIH HPC Helpdesk:

- Generic Linux or programming questions (try [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)).
- Managing users, groups, and projects on the clusters (use hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de).
- Generic help with Snakemake or other workflow engines (See [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/snakemake) for getting help with Snakemake).
- Help with bioinformatics or other scientific software.
  Please contact the authors/communities of these software for help (also known as "upstream").

We're happy to see if we can help when there is a concrete problem with the software, e.g.,

- something that breaks from one week to another without you changing anything and you assume a change on the cluster, or
- you need a generic dependency that you cannot install via conda or on your own.
  Please read the section [Administration-Provided Software](../misc/provided-software.md) to learn about the kinds of software that we will install and the kinds that we will not.
