# HPC Talk

Another community-driven possibility to get help is our HPC Talk portal. After this manual, it should be the first place to consult.

For those who are familiar with it, it resembles the concept of stack overflow, only without the voting.

Its main purpose is to server as a FAQ, so with time and more people participating, you will more likely find an answer to your question.

Also, we use it to make announcements and give an up-to-date status of current problems with the cluster, so it is worth to look at it every once in a while, or the first place to look at if you experience problems with the cluster to see if this is a known issue.

Despite users also being able to anser questions, our admins do participate on a regular basis.
