# HPC Talk

Another community-driven possibility to get help is our “HPC Talk” forum. After this manual, it should be the first place to consult.

https://hpc-talk.cubi.bihealth.org/

Its main purpose is to serve as a FAQ, so with time and more people participating, you will more likely find an answer to your question.
We also use it to make announcements and give an up-to-date status of current problems with the cluster, so it is worth logging in every once in a while.
It is also a great first place to look at if you're experiencing problems with the cluster.
Maybe it's a known issue.

Despite users also being able to answer questions, our admins do participate on a regular basis.
