But how can you do this easily? The key command to this magic is <code>sbatch</code>. This tutorial will show you how you can use this efficiently.</p>"},{"location":"first-steps/episode-2/#the-sbatch-command","title":"The <code>sbatch</code> Command","text":"<p>So what is <code>sbatch</code> doing for you?</p> <p>You use the <code>sbatch</code> command in front of the script you actually want to run. <code>sbatch</code> then puts your job into the job queue. The job scheduler looks at the current status of the whole system and will assign the first job in the queue to a node that is free in terms of computational load. If all machines are busy, yours will wait. But your job will sooner or later get assigned to a free node.</p> <p>We strongly recommend using this process for starting your computationally intensive tasks because you will get the best performance for your job and the whole system won't be disturbed by jobs that are locally blocking nodes. Thus, everybody using the cluster benefits.</p> <p>You may have noticed that you run <code>sbatch</code> with a script, not with regular commands. The reason is that <code>sbatch</code> only accepts bash scripts. If you give <code>sbatch</code> a normal shell command or binary, it won't work. This means that we have to put the command(s) we want to use in a bash script. A skeleton script can be found at <code>/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/submit_job.sh</code></p> <p>The content of the file:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set a name for the job (-J or --job-name).\n#SBATCH --job-name=tutorial\n\n# Set the file to write the stdout and stderr to (if -e is not set; -o or --output).\n#SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.log\n\n# Set the number of cores (-n or --ntasks).\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n\n# Force allocation of the two cores on ONE node.\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n\n# Set the total memory. Units can be given in T|G|M|K.\n#SBATCH --mem=8G\n\n# Optionally, set the partition to be used (-p or --partition).\n#SBATCH --partition=medium\n\n# Set the expected running time of your job (-t or --time).\n# Formats are MM:SS, HH:MM:SS, Days-HH, Days-HH:MM, Days-HH:MM:SS\n#SBATCH --time=30:00\n\nexport TMPDIR=/fast/users/${USER}/scratch/tmp\nmkdir -p ${TMPDIR}\n</code></pre> <p>The lines starting with <code>#SBATCH</code> are actually setting parameters for a <code>sbatch</code> command, so <code>#SBATCH --job-name=tutorial</code> is equal to <code>sbatch --job-name=tutorial</code>. Slurm will create a log file with a file name composed of the job name (<code>%x</code>) and the job ID (<code>%j</code>), e.g. <code>logs/tutorial-XXXX.log</code>. It will not automatically create the <code>logs</code> directory, we need to do this manually first. Here, we emphasize the importance of the log files! They are the first place to look if anything goes wrong.</p> <p>To start now with our tutorial, create a new tutorial directory with a log directory, e.g.,</p> <pre><code>(first-steps) $ mkdir -p /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode2/logs\n</code></pre> <p>and copy the wrapper script to this directory:</p> <pre><code>(first-steps) $ pushd /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode2\n(first-steps) $ cp /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/submit_job.sh .\n(first-steps) $ chmod u+w submit_job.sh\n</code></pre> <p>Now open this file and copy the same commands we executed in the last tutorial to this file.</p> <p>To keep it simple, we will put everything into one script. This is perfectly fine because the alignment and indexing are sequential. But there are two steps that could be run in parallel, namely the variant calling, because they don't depend on each other.

The same would be true for running <code>squeue -i</code> which performs an internal loop.</p> <p>\ud83d\udc4d Use the Slurm query commands only when you actually need the output.

The content resembles the same steps we took in the previous tutorials. Although every step has its own rule (alignment, snp calling, structural variant calling), we could instead have written everything in one rule. It is up to you to design your rules! Note that the rule names are arbitrary and not mentioned anywhere else in the file.</p> <p>But there is one primary rule: the <code>rule all</code>. This is the kickoff rule that makes everything run.</p> <p>As you might have noticed, every rule has three main parameters: <code>input</code>, <code>output</code> and <code>shell</code>. <code>input</code> defines the files that are going into the rule, <code>output</code> those that are produced when executing the rule, and <code>shell</code> is the bash script that processes <code>input</code> to produce <code>output</code>.</p> <p>Rule <code>all</code> does not have any <code>output</code> or <code>shell</code>, it uses <code>input</code> to start the chain of rules. Note that the input files of this rule are the output files of rule <code>snps</code> and <code>structural_variants</code>. The input of those rules is the output of rule <code>alignment</code>. This is how Snakemake processes the rules: It looks for rule <code>all</code> (or a rule that just has <code>input</code> files) and figures out how it can create the required input files with other rules by looking at their <code>output</code> files (the <code>input</code> files of one rule must be the <code>output</code> files of another rule). In our case it traces the workflow back to rule <code>snps</code> and <code>structural_variants</code> as they have the matching output files. They depend in return on the alignment, so the <code>alignment</code> rule must be executed, and this is the first thing that will be done by Snakemake.</p> <p>There are also some peculiarities about Snakemake:</p> <ul> <li>You can name files in <code>input</code> or <code>output</code> as is done in rule <code>alignment</code> with the output files.</li> <li>You can access the <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> files in the script by writing <code>{input}</code> or <code>{output}</code>.<ul> <li>If they are not named, they will be concatenated, separated by white space</li> <li>If they are named, access them with their name, e.g., <code>{output.bam}</code></li> <li>Curly braces must be escaped with curly braces, e.g., for bash variables: <code>${{VAR}}</code> instead of <code>${VAR}</code> but not Snakemake internal variables like <code>{input}</code> or <code>{output}</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>In the rule <code>structural_variants</code> we cheat a bit because delly does not produce output files if it can't find variants.<ul> <li>We do this by <code>touching</code> (i.e., creating) the required output file. Snakemake has a function for doing so (call <code>touch()</code> on the filename).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Intermediate folders in the path to output files are always created if they don't exist.</li> <li>Because Snakemake is Python based, you can write your own functions for it to use, e.g. for creating file names automatically.</li> </ul> <p>But Snakemake can do more. It is able to parse the paths of the output files and set wildcards if you want. For this your input (and output) file names have to follow a parsable scheme. In our case they do! Our FASTQ files, our only initial input files, start with <code>test</code>. The output of the alignment as well as the variant calling is also prefixed <code>test</code>. We now can modify the Snakemake file accordingly, by exchanging every occurrence of <code>test</code> in each <code>input</code> or <code>output</code> field with <code>{id}</code> (note that you could also give a different name for your variable). Only the input rule should not be touched, otherwise Snakemake would not know which value this variable should have. Your <code>Snakefile</code> should look now like this:</p> <pre><code>rule all:\n    input:\n        'snps/test.vcf',\n        'structural_variants/test.vcf'\n\nrule alignment:\n    input:\n        '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/{id}_R1.fq.gz',\n        '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/{id}_R2.fq.gz',\n    output:\n        bam='alignment/{id}.bam',\n        bai='alignment/{id}.bam.bai',\n    shell:\nr\"\"\"\n        export TMPDIR=/fast/users/${{USER}}/scratch/tmp\n        mkdir -p ${{TMPDIR}}\n\n        BWAREF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/precomputed/BWA/0.7.17/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta\n\n        bwa mem -t 8 \\\n            -R \"@RG\\tID:FLOWCELL.LANE\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tLB:test\\tSM:PA01\" \\\n            ${{BWAREF}} \\\n            {input} \\\n        | samtools view -b \\\n        | samtools sort -O BAM -T ${{TMPDIR}} -o {output.bam}\n\n        samtools index {output.bam}\n        \"\"\"\n\nrule structural_variants:\n    input:\n        'alignment/{id}.bam'\n    output:\n        'structural_variants/{id}.vcf'\n    shell:\nr\"\"\"\n        REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta\n\n        delly call -o {output} -g ${{REF}} {input}\n        \"\"\"\n\nrule snps:\n    input:\n        'alignment/{id}.bam'\n    output:\n        'snps/{id}.vcf'\n    shell:\nr\"\"\"\n        REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta\n\n        gatk HaplotypeCaller \\\n            -R ${{REF}} \\\n            -I {input} \\\n            -ploidy 2 \\\n            -O {output}\n        \"\"\"\n</code></pre> <p>Before we finally run this, we can make a dry run.

Note that <code>LOGDIR</code> has a subfolder named <code>$SLURM_JOB_NAME-$SLURM_JOB_ID</code> that will be created for you.

Unix locales are a set of environment variables and settings that define how various aspects of software and user interactions should be handled to accommodate different languages, regions, and cultural conventions. They play a crucial role in enabling software to adapt to local preferences for displaying text, formatting numbers, handling dates, and more.</p> <p>In a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux or macOS), locales provide a way to customize how programs behave based on the user's language, country, and cultural norms. Here are some of the key components of Unix locales:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Language: The primary language used for messages, menus, prompts, and system output. For instance, if you set your locale to \"en_US\", messages and interfaces will be in English (United States).</p> </li> <li> <p>Region: The country or region that defines conventions for aspects like date and time formatting, number formatting (decimal point or comma, thousands separator, etc.), and currency symbols. For example, \"en_GB\" represents English (Great Britain).</p> </li> <li> <p>Character Encoding: Specifies how characters are encoded, which is vital for correctly displaying and handling text in various scripts and languages. Common encodings include UTF-8 for Unicode text.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collation: Defines how strings should be sorted. Different languages have different sorting orders for characters, and the locale determines the appropriate collation rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>Numeric and Date Formats: Specifies how numbers, dates, and times should be formatted. Different regions have different conventions for date formats (dd/mm/yyyy vs. mm/dd/yyyy) and numerical representations (commas vs. periods as decimal points).</p> </li> <li> <p>Currency Symbols: Defines the symbol or abbreviation used for representing currency. This is important for currency formatting in software.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Unix locales are typically identified by a combination of language and region codes, like \"en_US\" for American English or \"fr_FR\" for French (France). These locales are stored in files on the system, and they contain the necessary rules and data for proper localization.</p> <p>Users and administrators can set the system's default locale, and individual users can override this setting in their environment. Here are some common commands used to manage locales:</p> <ul> <li><code>locale</code>: Displays the current locale settings.</li> <li><code>locale -a</code>: Lists all available locales on the system.</li> <li><code>export LC_ALL=locale_code</code>: Temporarily sets the locale for the current session.</li> <li><code>update-locale locale_code</code>: Changes the system-wide default locale.</li> </ul> <p>Programs that are designed to be locale-aware use these settings to display messages, format numbers and dates, and handle other language-dependent features. This allows software to be more user-friendly and relevant to different linguistic and cultural contexts.</p> <p>In summary, Unix locales provide a framework for adapting software behavior to match the language, region, and cultural preferences of users, ensuring a more inclusive and globally accessible computing experience.</p>"},{"location":"help/faq/#which-cuda-version-is-installed","title":"Which CUDA version is installed?","text":"<p>For this, connect to the node you want to query (via SSH but do not perform any computation via SSH!)</p> <pre><code>res-login-1:~$ ssh hpc-gpu-1\nhpc-gpu-1:~$ yum list installed 2&gt;/dev/null | grep cuda.x86_64\ncuda.x86_64                               10.2.89-1                  @local-cuda\nnvidia-driver-latest-dkms-cuda.x86_64     3:440.64.00-1.el7          @local-cuda\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"help/faq/#can-i-use-docker-on-the-cluster","title":"Can I use Docker on the Cluster?","text":"<p>No, as Docker essentially gives you access as the root user.</p> <p>However, you can use Apptainer (former Singularity) to run containers (and even many Docker contains if they are \"properly built\").

As such, we will not be able to handle them here comprehensively. Rather, we will give a tour de force on practical and minimal approaches of debugging of software. Here, debugging refers to the process of locating errors in your program and removing them.</p> <p>Origin of the term debugging</p> <p>The terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However, the term \"bug\", in the sense of \"technical error\", dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion).</p> <p>-- Wikipedia: Debugging</p> <p>When forgetting a moment about everything known about software engineering, programming roughly work sin the following cycle:</p> <p></p> <p>You run your program. In the case of failure, you need to remove the problem until the program runs through. You then start implementing the next change or feature. But how do you actually locate the problem?

Rather, pseudo random number generators are used that are usually seeded with a special value. In many cases, the current time is used which makes it hard to reproduce problems. Rather, use a fixed seed, e.g., by calling <code>srand(42)</code> in C. You could also make this a parameter of your program, but make sure that you can fix all pseudo randomness in your program so you can deterministically reproduce its behaviour.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#step-3-create-a-minimal-working-example-mwe","title":"Step 3: Create a minimal working example (MWE)","text":"<p>Try to find a minimal input set on which you can produce your problem.

We will need to note down the precise version we used so later we can load it for running Gromacs with the appropriate libraries. We will install gromacs into <code>$HOME/work/software</code>, which is appropriate for user-installed software, but it could also go into a group or project directory. Note that we install the software into your work directory as software installations are quite large and might go above your home quota. Also, software installations are usually not precious enough to waste resources on snapshots and backups.

Specific installations of i.e. python from conda can be used similarly in other interactive apps.</p> <ul> <li>For reproducibility this environment should clearly define all package versions and include dependencies. This is easiest to achieve by first collecting all packages you need into a primary collection (i.e. a yaml file, potentially including a specific R version for r-base if needed) and creating an environment from there. Exporting this environment will generate a file with all used packages and their version numbers, that can be used to recreate the same environment.</li> <li>Example code:</li> </ul> Click to expand  * Commands:   + `conda env create -n R-example -f R-example.yaml`   + `conda activate R-example`   + `conda env export -f R-fixed-versions.yaml`   + `conda env create -n R-fixed-versions -f R-fixed-versions.yaml` * R-example.yaml  <pre><code>channels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - r-base\n  - r-essentials\n  - r-devtools\n  - bioconductor-deseq2\n  - r-tidyverse\n  - r-rmarkdown\n  - r-knitr\n  - r-dt\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>R packages only available from github</li> </ul> <p>Some packages (i.e. several single-cell-RNAseq analysis tools) are only available from github and not on Cran/Bioconductor. There are two ways to install such packages into a conda enviroment.</p> Click to expand  1) Install from inside R \\[easier option, but not pure conda\\]  * First setup the conda env, ideally including all dependencies for the desired package from github (and do include r-devtools) * Then within R run `devtools::install_github('owner/repo', dependencies=F, upgrade=F, lib='/path/to/conda/env-name/lib/R/library')` * if you don't have all dependencies already installed you will have to omit dependencies=F and risk a mix of conda &amp; native R installed packages (or just have to redo the conda env). * github_install involves a build process and still needs a bit of memory, so this might crash on the default `srun --pty bash -i` shell  2) Build packages into a local conda channel \\[takes longer, but pure conda\\]\\    This approach is mostly taken from the answers given [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52061664/install-r-package-from-github-using-conda). These steps must be taken _before_ building the final env used with Rstudio  * use `conda skeleton cran https://github.com/owner/repo [--git-tag vX.Y]` to generate build files   * conda skeleton only works for repositories with a release/version tag. If the package you want to install does not have that, you either need to create a fork and add a such a tag, or find a fork that already did that. Downloading the code directly from github and building the package from that is also possible, but you will the need to manually set up the `meta.yaml` and `build.sh` files that conda skeleton would create.   * If there is more than one release tag, do specify which one you want, it may not automatically take the most recent one.   * If any r-packages from bioconductor are dependencies, conda will not find them during the build process. You will need to change the respective entries in the `meta.yaml` file created by conda skeleton. I.e. change `r-deseq2` to `bioconductor-deseq2` * Build the package with `conda build --R= [--use-local] r-`   * You need to specifying the same R-version used in the final conda env   * If the github package has additional dependencies from github, build those first and then add `--use-local` so the build process can find them.   * The build process definitely needs more memory than the default `srun --pty bash -i` shell. It also takes quite a bit of time (much longer than installing through devtools::install_github) * Finally add the packages (+versions) you built to the environment definition (i.e. yaml file) and create the (final) conda environment. Don't forget to tell conda to use locally build packages (either supply `--use-local` or add `- local` to the channel list in the yaml file)   <p>Starting the Rstudio session via the OnDemand portal works almost as described above (see Example 1). However, you do have to select `miniconda` as R source and provide the path to your miniconda installation and (separated by a colon) the name of the (newly created) conda enviroment you want to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Additional notes:</p> <ul> <li>Updating the conda env, that an already running rstudio instance is using, does work but does requires a restart of the R session to take effect</li> <li>If you are starting a new interactive Rstudio session but with a different conda environment than before, Rstudio will still start from the same project as before. In this case the 'old' project likely still contains the previous <code>.libPaths()</code> entries and therefore a link to your previous conda installation. Creating a new project cleans <code>.libPaths()</code> to only the env specified in setting up the Rstudio session.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ondemand/overview/","title":"The Open OnDemand Portal","text":"<p>Status / Stability</p> <p>OnDemand Support is currently in beta phase on the BIH HPC.

Most likely, your computer (or even your smartphone) has multiple processors (or cores). You can run multiple programs on the same computer and the fact that (a) there is more than one core and (b) there is more than one program running is not known to the running programs (unless they explicitly communicate with each other). Different programs can explicitly take advantage of the multiple processor cores. The main difference is that you normally use your computer in an interactive fashion (you perform an action and expect an immediate reaction).</p> <p>Even with a single processor (and core), your computer manages to run more than one program at the same time. This is done with the so-called time-slicing approach where the operating system lets each programs run in turn for a short time (a few milliseconds). A program with a higher priority will get more time slices than one with a lower (e.g., your audio player has real-time requirements and you will hear artifacts if it is starved for compute resources). Your operating system protects programs from each other by creating an address space for each. When two programs are running, the value of the memory at any given position in one program is independent from the value in the other program. Your operating system offers explicit functionality for sharing certain memory areas that two programs can use to exchange data efficiently.</p> <p>Similarly, file permissions with Unix users/groups or Unix/Windows ACLs (access control lists) are used to isolate users from each other. Programs can share data by accessing the same file if they can both access it. There are special files called sockets that allow for network-like inter-process communication but of course two programs on the same computer can also connect (virtually) via the computer network (no data will actually go through a cable).</p>"},{"location":"slurm/background/#interlude-resource-types","title":"Interlude: Resource Types","text":"<p>As another diversion, let us consider how Unix manages its resources. This is important to understand when requesting resources from the scheduler later on.</p> <p>First of all, a computer might offer a certain feature such as a specific hardware platform or special network connection. Examples for this on the BIH HPC are specific Intel processor generations such as <code>haswell</code> or the availability of Infiniband networking. You can request these with so-called constraints; they are not allocated to specific jobs.</p> <p>Second, there are resources that are allocated to specific jobs. The most important resources here are:</p> <ul> <li>computing resources (processors/CPUs (central progressing units) and cores, details are explained below),</li> <li>main memory / RAM,</li> <li>special hardware such as GPUs, and</li> <li>(wall-clock) time that a job wants to run as an upper bound.</li> </ul> <p>Generally, once a resource has been allocated to one job, it is not available to another. This means if you allocating more resources to your job that you actually need (overallocation) then those resources are not available to other jobs (whether they are your jobs or those of other users). This will be explained further below.</p> <p>Another example of resource allocation are licenses. The BIH HPC has a few Matlab 2016b licenses that users can request. As long as a license is allocated to one job, it is unavailable to another.</p>"},{"location":"slurm/background/#nodes-sockets-processors-cores-threads","title":"Nodes, Sockets, Processors, Cores, Threads","text":"<p>Regarding compute resources, Slurm differentiates between:</p> <ul> <li>nodes: a compute server,</li> <li>sockets: a socket in the compute server that hosts one physical processor,</li> <li>processor: a CPU or a CPU core in a multi-core computer (all CPUs in the BIH HPC are multi-core), and</li> <li>(hardware) threads: most Intel CPUs feature hardware threads (also known as \"hyperthreading\") where each core appears to be two cores.</li> </ul> <p>In most cases, you will use one compute node only. When using more than one node, you will need to use some form of message passing, e.g., MPI, so processes on different nodes can communicate.

We will not further go into detail here. Slurm provides many different features of ways to specify allocation of \"pinning\" to specific process locations. If you need this feature, we trust that you find sufficient explanation in the Slurm documentation.</p> <p>Usually, you would allocate multiple cores (a term Slurm uses synonymously with processors) on a single node (allocation on a single node is the default).</p>"},{"location":"slurm/background/#how-scheduling-works","title":"How Scheduling Works","text":"<p>Slurm is an acronym for \"Simple Linux Unix Resource Manager\" (note that the word \"scheduler\" does not occur here). Actually, one classically differentiates between the managing of resources and the scheduling of jobs that use them. The resource manager allocates resources according to a user's request for a job and ensures that there are no conflicts. If the required resources are not available, the scheduler puts the user's job into a queue. Later, when then requested resources become available the scheduler assigns them to the job and runs it. In the following, both resource allocation and the running of the job are described as being done by the scheduler.</p> <p>The interesting case occurs when there are not enough resources available for at least two jobs submitted to the scheduler. The scheduler has to decide how to proceed. Consider the simplified case of only scheduling cores. Each job will request a number of cores. The scheduler will then generate a scheduling plan that might look as follows.</p> <pre><code>core\n  ^\n4 |   |---job2---|\n3 |   |---job2---|\n2 |   |---job2---|\n1 | |--job1--|\n  +--------------------------&gt; t time\n       5    1    1    2\n            0    5    0\n</code></pre> <p><code>job1</code> has been allocated one core and <code>job2</code> has been allocated two cores. When <code>job3</code>, requesting one core is submitted at t = 5, it has to wait at least as long until <code>job1</code> is finished. If <code>job3</code> requested two or more cores, it would have to wait at least until <code>job2</code> also finished.</p> <p>We can now ask several questions, including the following:</p> <ol> <li>What if a job runs for less than the allocated time?     -- In this case, resources become free and the scheduler will attempt to select the next job(s) to run.</li> <li>What if a job runs longer than the allocated time?     -- In this case, the scheduler will send an informative Unix signal to the process first.     The job will be given a bit more time and if it does not exit it will be forcibly terminated.     You will find a note about this at the end of your job log file.</li> <li>What if multiple jobs compete for resources?     -- The scheduler will prefer certain jobs over others using the Slurm Multifactor Priority Plugin.     In practice, small jobs will be preferred over large, users with few used resources in the last month will be favored over heavy consumers, long-waiting jobs will be favored over recently submitted jobs, and many other factors.     You can use the sprio utility to inspect these factors in real-time.</li> <li>How does the scheduler handle new requests?     -- Generally, the scheduler will add new jobs to the waiting queue.     The scheduler regularly adjusts its planning by recalculating job priorities.     Slurm is configured to perform computationally simple schedule recalculations quite often and larger recalculations more infrequently.</li> </ol> <p>Also see the Slurm Frequently Asked Questions.</p> <p>Please note that even if all jobs were known at the start of time, scheduling is still a so-called NP-complete problem. Entire computer science journals and books are dedicated only to scheduling. Things get more complex in the case of online scheduling, in which new jobs can appear at any time. In practice, Slurm does a fantastic job with its heuristics but it heavily relies on parameter tuning. HPC administration is constantly working on optimizing the scheduler settings. Note that you can use the <code>--format</code> option to the <code>squeue</code> command to request that it shows you information about job scheduling (in particular, see the <code>%S</code> field, which will show you the expected start time for a job, assuming Slurm has calculated it). See <code>man squeue</code> for details.

This section first gives some technical background and then explains how to implement this properly with Slurm on the BIH HPC.</p>"},{"location":"slurm/memory-allocation/#technical-background","title":"Technical Background","text":"<p>Technical Background Summary</p> <ul> <li>virtual memory is what your programs tells the operating system it wants to use</li> <li>resident set size is the amount of memory that your program actually uses</li> <li>most memory will be allocated on the heap</li> </ul> <p>Main memory used to be one of the most important topics when programming, as computers had so little. There is the infamous quote \"640KB ought ot be enough for anybody\" wrongly attribute to Bill Gates which refers to the fact that early computers could only address that amount of memory. In MS DOS, one had to use special libraries for a program to use more memory. Today, computers are very fast and memory is plentiful and people can (rightfully) forget about memory allocation ... as long as they don't use \"much\" memory by today's standards.</p> <p>The Linux operating system differentiates between the following types of memory:</p> <ul> <li>virtual memory size (vsize), the amount of memory that a process (virtually) allocates,</li> <li>resident set size (rss), the amount of memory actually used and currently in the computer's main memory,</li> <li>the swap memory usage, the amount of active memory that is not present in main memory but on the computer's disk,</li> <li>sometimes, the shared memory is also interesting, and</li> <li>it might be interesting to know about heap and stack size.</li> </ul> <p>Note that above we are talking about processes, not Slurm jobs yet. Let us look at this in detail:</p> <p>Each program uses some kind of memory management. For example, in C the <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> functions manually allocate and free memory while in Java, R, and Python, memory allocation and release is done automatically using a concept called garbage collection. Each program starts with a certain virtual memory size, that is the amount of memory it can address, say 128MB. When the program allocates memory, the memory allocation mechanism will check whether it has sufficient space left. If not, it will request an increase in virtual memory from the operating system, e.g., to 256MB. If this fails then the program can try to handle the error, e.g., terminate gracefully, but many programs will just panic and stop. Otherwise, the program will get access to more memory and happily continue to run.</p> <p>However, programs can allocate humonguous amounts of virtual memory and only use a little. Memory is organized in \"pages\" (classically these are 4096 bytes each, but can be larger using so-called \"huge page\" features). The operating system tracks which memory pages are actually used by a process. The total size of these pages is called the resident set size: the amount of memory that is actually currently used by a program. Programs can also mark pages as unused again, thus freeing resident memory and can also decrease their virtual memory.</p> <p>In some cases it is still interesting to use swap memory. Here, the contents of resident memory are copied to disk by the operating system. This process is completely transparent to the program; the data remains available at the original positions in the virtual memory! However, accessing it will take some time as it must be read back into main memory from the disk. In this way, it was possible for a computer with 4MB of RAM and a disk of 100MB to run programs that used 8MB. Of course, this was only really useable for programs that ran in the background. One could really feel the latency if a graphical program was using swapped memory (you could actually hear the hard drive working). Today, swap storage is normally only relevant when put your computer into hibernation. Given the large main memory on the cluster nodes, their small local hard drives (just used for loading the operating system), and the extreme slowness involved in using swapped memory, the BIH HPC nodes have no swap memory allocated.</p> <p>Most HPC users will also use shared memory, at least implicitly. Whenever a program uses <code>fork</code> to create a subprocess (BTW, this is not a thread), the program can chose to \"copy\" its current address space. The second process then has access to the same memory than the parent process in a copy-on-write fashion. This allows, for example, pre-loading a database, and also allows the use of already loaded library code by the child process as well. If the child process writes to the copy-on-write memory of the parent, the relevant memory page will be copied and attributed to the child.</p> <p>Two or more processes can share the same memory explicitly. This is usually used for inter-process communication but the Bowtie program uses it for sharing the memory of indices. For example, the Python <code>multiprocessing</code> module will use this, including if you have two MPI processes running on the same host.</p> <p>Memory is also separated into segments, the most interesting ones are heap and stack memory. For compiled languages, memory can be allocated on either. For C, an <code>int</code> variable will be allocated on the stack. Every time you call a function, a stack frame is created in memory to hold the local variables and other information for the duration of the function execution. The stack thus grows through function calls made by your program and shrinks when the functions return. The stack size for a process is limited (by <code>ulimit -s</code>) and a program that goes too deep (e.g., via infinite recursion) will be terminated by the operating system if it exceeds this limit. Again in C, <code>int * ptr = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));</code> will allocate memory for one variable (an integer pointer) on the stack and memory for 10 integers on the heap. When the function returns, the <code>ptr</code> variable on the stack will be freed but to free the array of integers, you'd have to call <code>free(ptr)</code>. If the memory is not freed then this constitutes a memory leak, but that is another topic.</p> <p>Other relevant segments are code, where the compiled code lives, and data, where static data such as strings displayed to the user are stored. As a side node, in interpreted languages such as R or Python, the code and data segments will refer to the code and data of Python while the actual program text will be on the heap.</p>"},{"location":"slurm/memory-allocation/#interlude-memory-in-java","title":"Interlude: Memory in Java","text":"<p>Memory in Java Summary</p> <ul> <li>set <code>-XX:MaxHeapSize=&lt;size&gt;</code> (e.g., <code>&lt;size&gt;=2G</code>) for your program and only tune the other parameters if needed</li> <li>also consider the amount of memory that Java needs for heap management in your Slurm allocations</li> </ul> <p>Java's memory management provides for some interesting artifacts. When running simple Java programs, you will never run into this but if you need to use gigabytes of memory in Java then you will have to learn a bit about Java memory management. This is the case when running GATK programs, for example.</p> <p>As different operating systems handle memory management differently, the Java virtual machine does its own memory management to provide a consistent interface.

The Java VM program itself will also consume memory on the OS stack but that is negligible.</p> <p>Overall, the Java VM needs to store in main memory:</p> <ul> <li>The Java VM, program code, Java thread stacks etc. (very little memory).</li> <li>The Java heap (potentially a lot of memory).</li> <li>The Java heap management data structures (so-called \"off-heap\", but of course on the OS heap) (potentially also considerable memory).</li> </ul> <p>In the BIH HPC context, the following is recommended to:</p> <ul> <li>Set the Java heap to an appropriate size (use trial-and-error to determine the correct size or look through internet forums).</li> <li>Only tune initial heap size in the case of performance issues (unlikely in batch processing).</li> <li>Only bump the stack size when problems occur.</li> <li>Consider \"off-heap\" memory when performing Slurm allocations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"slurm/memory-allocation/#memory-allocation-in-slurm","title":"Memory Allocation in Slurm","text":"<p>Memory Allocation in Slurm Summary</p> <ul> <li>most user will simply use <code>--memory=&lt;size&gt;</code> (e.g., <code>&lt;size&gt;=3G</code>) to allocate memory per node</li> <li>both interactive <code>srun</code> and batch <code>sbatch</code> jobs are governed by Slurm memory allocation</li> <li>the sum of all memory of all processes started by your job may not exceed the job reservation.</li> <li>please don't over-allocate memory, see \"Memory Accounting in Slurm\" below for details</li> </ul> <p>Our Slurm configuration uses Linux cgroups to enforce a maximum amount of resident memory. You simply specify it using <code>--memory=&lt;size&gt;</code> in your <code>srun</code> and <code>sbatch</code> command.</p> <p>In the (rare) case that you provide more flexible number of threads (Slurm tasks) or GPUs, you could also look into <code>--mem-per-cpu</code> and <code>--mem-per-gpu</code>. The official Slurm sbatch manual is quite helpful, as is <code>man sbatch</code> on the cluster command line.</p> <p>Slurm (or rather Linux via cgroups) will track all memory started by all jobs by your process. If each process works independently (e.g., you put the output through a pipe <code>prog1 | prog2</code>) then the amount of memory consumed will at any given time be the sum of the RSS of both processes at that time. If your program uses <code>fork</code>, which uses memory in a copy-on-write fashion, the shared memory is of course only counted once. Note that Python's multiprocessing does not use copy on write: its data will be explicitly copied and consume additional memory. Refer to the Scipy/Numpy/Pandas etc. documentation on how to achieve parallelism without copying too much data.</p> <p>The amount of virtual memory that your program can reserve is only \"virtually\" unlimited (pun not intended). However, in practice, the operating system will not like you allocating more than physically available. If your program attempts to allocate more memory than requested via Slurm, your program will be killed.</p> <p>This is reported to you in the Slurm job output log as something like:</p> <pre><code>slurmstepd: error: Detected 1 oom-kill event(s) in step &lt;JOB ID&gt;.batch cgroup.
