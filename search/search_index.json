The group leader sends an email to hpc-gatekeeper@bihealth.de and fills out the form below. Please consider the notes below on this page. hpc-gatekeeper decides on the request and the corresponding objects are created on the cluster (users, groups, directories). All new users are notified and further instructions are sent to them via email. Subsequently, both owner and delegate (but only owner and delegate ) can initiate changes (new users, resource changes etc.) to the group.

Through the delegate mechanism, control can be delegated to up to one person (e.g., post-doc in the lab). Users can be members of one work group only. For multi-group collaborations, please use the project mechanism described below. Projects \u00b6 Projects are very similar to work groups with the main distinction that users can be a member of more than one project, but project membership does not grant cluster access (group membership is still required).

Next Maintenance Window \u00b6 HPC 4 Research: Miscellaneous Maintenances, December 1, 2020 \u00b6 Time : 6am-12am Exchange GPFS Controller We need to exchange a central piece of hardware in the storage system. We do not expect a downtime, only a degradation of service. Access to the GPFS will be degraded Slurm Scheduler Upgrade to the latest and greatest version. Restructure scheduler installation to ease rolling upgrades without future downtimes. Archival of old accounting information to improve schedule performance. Slurm will be unavailable. Re-Mounting of GPFS The /fast file system will be re-mounted to /data/gpfs-1 . /fast becomes a symbolic link to /data on all of the cluster. GPFS access will disappear for some time. Login & Transfer Node Migration The login nodes will be moved from physical machines to virtual machines in high-availability mode. Further, they will be available as login-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org and login-2... instead of med-login{1,2} . The same is true for, med-transfer{1,2} which will be replaced by transfer-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org and transfer-2... . The aim is to improve stability and make everything easier to manage by administration. Current Status / Result \u00b6 We had to clear the accounting information database to make the update work within an acceptable time (we have 4M+ jobs in there). From now on we will only keep the last 31 days in the database (updated nightly). The old login and transfer nodes have been made available as nodes med010[1-3] and med012[5-6] . All nodes are available again. The maintenance is complete. CentOS 8 Migration (in planning) \u00b6 Note This task is currently being planned. No schedule has been fixed yet. All nodes will be upgraded to CentOS 8. This will be done in a rolling fashion over the course of 1 month. The login nodes must be rebooted which we will do with a break of 2 days (one node will remain running). Finalize unification of Mass Data Mounts \u00b6 Note This task is currently being planned. No schedule has been fixed yet. We will remove the bind mount /fast that currently points to /data/gpfs-1 on HPC 4 Research. Users should use /data instead of /fast everywhere, e.g., /data/users/$NAME etc. Previous Maintenance Windows \u00b6 Slurm Scheduler Updates: September 8, 2020 \u00b6 To improve the scheduling behaviour we will need to restart the Slurm scheduler at ~8am. If everything runs well, this will finish after 30minutes (8:30 am). Planned Scheduler Changes: Introduce automatic routing of jobs to partitions. Make Slurm scheduler and accounting run more robustly. Network Maintenance: June 3, 2020 \u00b6 On June 3, we need to perform a network maintenance at 8 am. If everything goes well, there might be a short delay in network packages and connections will survive. In this case, the maintenance will end 8:30 am. Otherwise, the maintenance will finish by noon. Cluster Maintenance with Downtime: June 16 \u00b6 We need to schedule a full cluster downtime on June 16. Slurm Migration \u00b6 We will switch to the Slurm workload scheduler (from the legacy SGE). The main reason is that Slurm allows for better scheduling of GPUs (and has loads of improvements over SGE), but the syntax is a bit different. Currently, our documentation is in an transient state. We are currently extending our Slurm-specific documentation . March 7, 2020 (test stage) : Slurm will provide 16 CPU and 3 GPU nodes (with 4 Tesla V100 each), and two high memory nodes, the remaining nodes are available in SGE. We ask users to look into scheduling with Slurm. March 31, 2020 (intermediate stage) : Half of the nodes will be migrated to the Slurm cluster (~100), all high memory and GPU nodes will be moved to Slurm. New users are advised to use not learn SGE any more but directly use Slurm. Support for SGE is limited to bug fixing only (documentation and tips are phased out). May 31, 2020 (sunsetting SGE) : All but 16 nodes will remain in the SGE cluster. June 31, 2020 (the end) : SGE has reached its end of life on hpc4research. SSH Key Management \u00b6 SSH Key Management has switched to using Charite and MDC ActiveDirectory servers. You need to upload all keys by the end of April 2020. MDC Key Upload Charite Key Upload Schedule Feb 4, 2020: Keys are now also taken from central MDC/Charite servers. You do not need to contact us any more to update your keys (we cannot accelerate the process at MDC). May 1, 2020: Keys are now only taken from central MDC/Charite servers. You must upload your keys to central servers by then. Switch update, Location Flip of med-login2 and med-transfer1 \u00b6 Monday, February 23, 9am-15am. Affected systems: med-transfer1 med-transfer2 med-login2 a few compute nodes The compute nodes are non-critical as we are taking them out of the queues now. CentOS 7.6 Upgrade, January 29, February 5 \u00b6 Wednesday, January 29, 2018: Reboot med-login1, med-transfer1 Wednesday, February 5, 2018: Reboot med-login2, med-transfer2 September 03-30, 2018 \u00b6 Starting monday 03.09.2018 we will be performing rolling update of the cluster from CentOS 7.4 to CentOS 7.5. Since update will be performed in small bunches of nodes, the only impact you should notice is smaller number of nodes available for computation. Also, for around two weeks, you can expect that your jobs can hit both CentOS 7.4 & CentOS 7.5 nodes. This should not impact you in any way, but if you encounter any unexpected behavior of the cluster during this time, please let us know. At some point we will have to update the transfer, and login nodes. We will do this also in parts, so the you can switch to the other machine. Key dates are: 18.09.2018 - med-login1 & med-transfer1 will not be available, and you should switch to med-login2 & med-transfer2 respectively. 25.09.2018 - med-login2 & med-transfer2 will not be available, and you should switch to med-login1 & med-transfer1 respectively. Please also be informed that non-invasive maintenance this weekend which we announced has been canceled, so cluster will operate normally. In case of any concerns, issues, do not hesitate to contact us via hpc-admin@bihealth.de , or hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de . June 18, 2018, 0600-1500 \u00b6 Due to tasks we need to perform on BIH cluster, we have planned maintenance: Maintenance start: 18.06.2018 06:00 AM Maintenance end: 18.06.2018 3:00 PM During maintenance we will perform several actions: GPFS drives re-balancing to improve performance OS update on cluster, transfer, and login nodes During maintenance whole cluster will not be usable, this includes: you will not be able to run jobs on cluster (SGE queuing system will be shutdown) med-login{1,2} nodes will not work reliably during this time med-transfer{1-2} nodes, and resources shared by them will be not available Maintenance window is quite long, since we are dependent on external vendor. However, we will recover services as soon as possible. We will keep you posted during maintenance with services status. March 16-18, 2018 (MDC IT) \u00b6 MDC IT has a network maintenance from Friday, March 16 18:00 hours until Sunday March 18 18:00 hours. This will affect connections to the cluster but no connections within the cluster. January 17, 2018 (Complete) \u00b6 STATUS: complete The first aim of this window is to upgrade the cluster to CentOS 7.4 to patch against the Meltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities. For this, the login and transfer nodes have to be rebooted. The second aim of this window is to reboot the file server to mitigate some NFS errors. For this, the SGE master has to be stopped for some time.

Also, for around two weeks, you can expect that your jobs can hit both CentOS 7.4 & CentOS 7.5 nodes. This should not impact you in any way, but if you encounter any unexpected behavior of the cluster during this time, please let us know.

The aim of the HPC systems is to support the users in their scientific work and relies on their cooperation. First and foremost, the administration team enforces state of the art IT security and reliability practices through their organizational and operational processes and actions. We kindly ask user to follow the Cluster Etiquette describe below to allow for fair use and flexible access to the shared resources. Beyond this, policies are introduced or enforced only when required to ensure non-restrictive access to the resources themselves. Major or recurrent breaches of policies may lead to exclusion from service. We will update this list of policies over time. Larger changes will be announced through the mailing list. Cluster Etiquette \u00b6 The clusters are soft-partitioned shared resources that are made available under a \"fair use\" policy as far as possible. The general assumption that if a user interferes with the work of others (e.g., by blocking compute slots) then this happens accidentally. Please do not do this. If you see this happening try to contact the user yourself (use getent passswd $USER to find out the user's office contact details). Send an email to hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de if you need administrative intervention. All users must be subscribed to the cluster mailing list (they are subscribed automatically when the account is created). When leaving please send an email to hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de such that we can shutdown your account in an organized fashion. We also need to arrange for cleaning up your data. The cluster mailing list bih-cluster@bihealth.de is the primary contact channel for administration to user. Users must be subscribed to the mailing list. Users must follow the announcements, failure to do so can lead to missing important policy changes and thus losing access to the cluster or data. Cluster Policies \u00b6 File System Policies \u00b6 In the case of violations marked with a shield ( ) administration reserves the right to remove write and possibly read permission to the given locations. Policies marked with a robot ( ) are automatically enforced. Storage on the GPFS file system is a sparse resource try to use both data volume and file sparingly. Note well that small files above ~4KB take up at least 8MB of space. Default quotas are as follows (each user, group, project has a home , work , and scratch volume). You can request an increase by an email to hpc-gatekeeper@bihealth.de . home 10k files, 1GB space work 2M files, 1TB space scratch 20M files, 200TB space The overall throughput limit is 20GB/sec. Try not to overload the cluster I/O wise. User home/work/group file sets have to be owned by the user, group is hpc-users and mode is u=rwx,go= ; POSIX ACLs are prohibited. This policy is automatically enforced every 5 minutes. Group and project home/work/group file sets have to be owned by the owner, group set to the corresponding unix group and mode is u=rwx,g=rwxs,o= ; POSIX ACLs are prohibited. This policy is automatically enforced every 5 minutes. All files in scratch will be moved into a read-only \"trash can\" inside scratch/BIH_TRASH after 14 days (by mtime ) over night. Trash directories will be removed after 14 further days. Users can arrange with hpc-gatekeeper@bihealth.de to keep files longer by using touch on files in scratch and subsequently bumping the mtime . In the case of abuse of this mechanism / failure to communicate with hpc-gatekeeper, administration reserves the right to drastically reduce scratch quota of affected users and employ other measures to ensure stability of operations. You can learn more in the Automated Scratch Cleanup section. Connections \u00b6 Network connections are a topic important in security. In the case of violations marked with a shield ( ) administration reserves the right to terminate connections without notice and perform other actions. Data transfers should happen through the transfer nodes (HPC 4 Research) and/or the compute nodes themselves. The cluster is not meant as a \"hop node\". Do not use it to connect to the login node first and then jump to another host outside of the cluster network. Doing so is a breach of cluster policies and quite possibly your organization's IT security policies As a corollary, SSH reverse tunnels are strictly prohibited. Outgoing connections are meant for data transfers only (in other words: using SSH/SCP to download file is fine). Do not leave outgoing connections open longer than necessary. Sessions of screen and tmux are only allowed to run on the head nodes. They will be terminated automatically on the compute nodes. Interactive Use \u00b6 Interactive sessions block resources to the scheduler. Reduce interactive use to the minimal time and resources possible. The cluster is optimized for batch processing. Interactive use is a secondary aim. Administration attempts to strike a good balance here but batch usage is most important. Consider using our Open on Demand service for interactive use. Interactive use should happen through the Slurm scheduler ( srun ). SSH connections to the nodes are allowed for monitoring purposes but not meant for computation. Administration enforces this by restricting all jobs outside of Slurm to use at most 1 core and 128 MB of RAM. This limit is enforced per node per user with Linux cgroups. GPU Use \u00b6 Interactive sessions block resources to the scheduler. Interactive GPU use is discouraged. Accessing GPUs outside of the Slurm scheduler has been disabled by administration.","title":"Policies"},{"location":"admin/policies/#cluster-etiquette","text":"The clusters are soft-partitioned shared resources that are made available under a \"fair use\" policy as far as possible.

General Aims \u00b6 Mostly, you can separate the files in your projects/pipelines into one of the following categories: scripts (and their documentation) configuration data Ideally, scripts and documentation are independent of a given project and can be separated from the rest. Configuration is project-dependent and small and mostly does not contain any sensitive information (such as genotypes that allows for reidentification of donors). In most cases, data might be large and is either also stored elsewhere or together with scripts and configuration can be regenerated easily. There is no backup of work and scratch The cluster GPFS file system /fast is not appropriate for keeping around single \"master\" copies of data. You should have a backup and archival strategy for your valuable \"master\" copy data. Best Practices \u00b6 Scripts \u00b6 Your scripts should go into version control, e.g., a Git repository. Your scripts should be driven by command line parameters and/or configuration such that no paths etc. are hard-coded. If for a second data set, you need to make a copy of your scripts and adjust some variables, e.g., at the top, you're doing something in a suboptimal fashion. Rather, get these values from the command line or a configuration file and only store (sensible) defaults in your script where appropriate. Thus, ideally your scripts are not project-specific. Configuration \u00b6 Your configuration usually is project-specific. Your configuration should also go into version contro, e.g., a Git repository. In addition, you might need project-specific \"wrapper\" scripts that just call your project-independent script with the correct paths for your project. These scripts rather fall into the \"configuration\" category and should then live together with your configuration. Data \u00b6 Your data should go into a location separate from your scripts and configuration. Ideally, the raw input data is separated from the work and output files such that you can make these files and directories read-only and don't accidentally damage these files. Temporary files You really should keep temporary files in a temporary directory, set the environment variable TMPDIR appropriately and automatically clean them up (see Useful Tips: Temporary Files ) Best Practices in Practice \u00b6 But how can we put this into practice? Below, we give some examples of how to do this. Note that for simplicity's sake we put all scripts and configuration into one directory/repository contrary to the best practices above. This is for educational purposes only and you should strive for reuseable scripts where it makes sense and separate scripts and configuration. We will limit this to simple Bash scripts for education's purposes. You should be able to easily adapt this to your use cases. Thus, the aim is to separate the data from the non-data part of the project such that we can put the non-data part of the project into a separate location and under version control. We call the location for non-data part of the project the home location of your project and the location for the data part of the project the work location of your project. Overall, we have three options: Your processes are run in the home location and the sub directories used for execution are links into the work location using symlinks. Your processes are run in the work location and the scripts are linked into the work location using symlinks, OR the scripts are called from the home location, maybe through project-specific wrapper scripts.

Conda is a package management system that is based on channels, and one of those channels provides a huge selection of bioinformatics software. Conda is written in Python and is based on recipes, such that everybody can write recipes for missing software (if there is any). In general the packages are pre-compiled and conda just downloads the binaries from the conda servers. You are in charge of managing your own software stack, but conda makes it easy to do so. We will provide you with a description on how to install conda and how to use it. Of course there are many online resources that you can also use. Please find a list at the end of the document. Also note that some system-level software is managed through environment modules. See System-near Software Provided by HPC Administration below. Premise \u00b6 When you logged into the cluster, please make sure that you also executed srun to log into a computation node and perform the software installation there. Installing conda \u00b6 res-login-1:~$ srun --pty bash -i med0127:~$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh med0127:~$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p $HOME /work/miniconda This will install conda to $HOME/work/miniconda . This path can be changed to your liking. Please note that the $HOME folder has limited space (an exception is the subfolder $HOME/work which has no space limit). NB: $HOME/scratch is not appropriate as files placed there will be removed automatically after 4 weeks. To make it available upon login, extend and export the $PATH variable with the installation path + /bin and add it to your $HOME/.bashrc : case \" ${ SLURMD_NODENAME - ${ HOSTNAME }} \" in login-* ) ;; * ) export PATH = $HOME /work/miniconda/condabin: $PATH ;; esac The above code makes sure that you don't have conda available on the login nodes, where you are not allowed to start any computations. To make bioinformatics software available, we have to add the bioconda and some other channels to the conda configuration: med0127:~$ conda config --add channels bioconda med0127:~$ conda config --add channels default med0127:~$ conda config --add channels conda-forge You can also add channels to your liking. Installing software with conda \u00b6 Installing packages with conda is straight forward: med0127:~$ conda install <package> This will install a package into the conda root environment. We will explain environments in detail in the next section. To search for a package, e.g. to find the correct name in conda or if it exists at all, issue the command: med0127:~$ conda search <string> To choose a specific version (conda will install the latest version that is compatible with the current installed Python version), you can provide the version as follows: med0127:~$ conda install <package> = <version> Please note that new conda installs may ship with a recently update Python version and not all packages might have been adapted. E.g., if you find out that some packages don't work after starting out/upgrading to Python 3.8, simply try to downgrade Python to 3.7 with conda install python=3.7 . Hint As resolving the dependency tree of an installation candidate can take a lot of time in Conda, especially when you are installing software from an environment.yaml file, an alternative resolver has been presented that you can use to install software into your Conda environment. The time savings are immense and an installation that took more than an hour can be resolved in seconds. Simply run med0127:~$ conda install mamba With that, you can install software into your environment using the same syntax as for Conda: med0127:~$ mamba install <package> Creating an environment \u00b6 Conda lets you create environments, such that you can test things in a different environment or group your software. Another common use case is to have different environments for the different Python versions. Since conda is Python-based, conflicting packages will mostly struggle with the Python version. By default, conda will install packages into its root environment. Please note that software that does not depend on Python and is installed in the root environment, is is available in all other environments.

Prerequisites \u00b6 This tutorial assumes familiarity with Linux/Unix operating systems. It also assumes that you have already connected to the cluster. We have collected some links to tutorials and manuals on the internet . Legend \u00b6 Before we start with our first steps tutorial, we would like to introduce the following convention that we use throughout the series: $ Commands are prefixed with a little dollar sign While file paths are highlighted like this: /fast/projects/cubit/current . Instant Gratification \u00b6 After connecting to the cluster, you are located on a login node. To get to your first compute node, type srun --time 7-00 --mem=8G --ntasks=8 --pty bash -i which will launch an interactive Bash session on a free remote node running up to 7 days, enabling you to use 8 cores and 8 Gb memory. Typing exit will you bring back to the login node. $ srun -p long --time 7-00 --mem=8G --ntasks=8 --pty bash -i med0107 $ exit $ See? That was easy! Preparation \u00b6 In preparation for our first steps tutorial series, we would like you to install the software for this tutorial. In general the users on the cluster will manage their own software with the help of conda. If you haven't done so so far, please follow the instructions in installing conda first. The only premise is that you are able to log into the cluster . Make also sure that you are logged in to a computation node using ``. Now we will create a new environment, so as to not interfere with your current or planned software stack, and install into it all the software that we need during the tutorial. Run the following commands: $ conda create -n first-steps python=3 snakemake drmaa bwa delly samtools gatk4 $ conda activate first-steps (first-steps) $ As you can see, we also installed a tool called DRMAA (which is in fact a software library). DRMAA is an API that provides more stable job distribution on the cluster than the native SGE implementation. We will use this during the tutorial and we recommend it for your every day usage.

This is part one of the \"First Steps\" BIH Cluster Tutorial. Here we will build a small pipeline with alignment and variant calling. The premise is that you have the tools installed as described in Episode 0 . For this episode, please make sure that you are on a compute node. As a reminder, the command to access a compute node with the required resources is $ srun --time 7-00 --mem=8G --ntasks=8 --pty bash -i Tutorial Input Files \u00b6 We will provide you with some example FASTQ files, but you can use your own if you like. You can find the data here: /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R1.fq.gz /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R2.fq.gz Creating a Project Directory \u00b6 First, you should create a folder where the output of this tutorial will go. It would be good to have it in your work directory in /fast/users/$USER , because it is faster and there is more space available. (first-steps) $ mkdir -p /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode1 (first-steps) $ pushd /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode1 Quotas / File System limits Note well that you have a quota of 1 GB in your home directory at /fast/users/$USER . The reason for this is that nightly snapshots and backups are created for this directory which are precious resources. This limit does not apply to your work directory at /fast/users/$USER/work . The limits are much higher here but no snapshots or backups are available. There is no limit on your scratch directory at /fast/users/$USER/scratch . However, files placed here are automatically removed after 4 weeks. This is only appropriate for files during download or temporary files. Creating a Directory for Temporary Files \u00b6 In general it is advisable to have a proper temporary directory available.

Welcome to the second episode of our tutorial series! Once you are logged in to the cluster, you have the possibility to distribute your jobs to all the nodes that are available. But how can you do this easily? The key command to this magic is sbatch . This tutorial will show you how you can use this efficiently. The sbatch Command \u00b6 So what is sbatch doing for you? You use the sbatch command in front of the script you actually want to run. sbatch then puts your job into the job queue. The job scheduler looks at the current status of the whole system and will assign the first job in the queue to a node that is free in terms of computational load. If all machines are busy, yours will wait. But your job will sooner or later get assigned to a free node. We strongly recommend using this process for starting your computationally intensive tasks because you will get the best performance for your job and the whole system won't be disturbed by jobs that are locally blocking nodes. Thus, everybody using the cluster benefits. You may have noticed that you run sbatch with a script, not with regular commands. The reason is that sbatch only accepts bash scripts. If you give sbatch a normal shell command or binary, it won't work. This means that we have to put the command(s) we want to use in a bash script. A skeleton script can be found at /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/submit_job.sh The content of the file: #!/bin/bash # Set a name for the job (-J or --job-name). #SBATCH --job-name=tutorial # Set the file to write the stdout and stderr to (if -e is not set; -o or --output). #SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.log # Set the number of cores (-n or --ntasks). #SBATCH --ntasks=8 # Force allocation of the two cores on ONE node. #SBATCH --nodes=1 # Set the total memory. Units can be given in T|G|M|K. #SBATCH --mem=8G # Optionally, set the partition to be used (-p or --partition). #SBATCH --partition=medium # Set the expected running time of your job (-t or --time). # Formats are MM:SS, HH:MM:SS, Days-HH, Days-HH:MM, Days-HH:MM:SS #SBATCH --time=30:00 export TMPDIR = /fast/users/ ${ USER } /scratch/tmp mkdir -p ${ TMPDIR } The lines starting with #SBATCH are actually setting parameters for a sbatch command, so #SBATCH --job-name=tutorial is equal to sbatch --job-name=tutorial . Slurm will create a log file with a file name composed of the job name ( %x ) and the job ID ( %j ), e.g. logs/tutorial-XXXX.log . It will not automatically create the logs directory, we need to do this manually first. Here, we emphasize the importance of the log files! They are the first place to look if anything goes wrong. To start now with our tutorial, create a new tutorial directory with a log directory, e.g., (first-steps) $ mkdir -p /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode2/logs and copy the wrapper script to this directory: (first-steps) $ pushd /fast/users/$USER/work/tutorial/episode2 (first-steps) $ cp /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/submit_job.sh . (first-steps) $ chmod u+w submit_job.sh Now open this file and copy the same commands we executed in the last tutorial to this file. To keep it simple, we will put everything into one script. This is perfectly fine because the alignment and indexing are sequential. But there are two steps that could be run in parallel, namely the variant calling, because they don't depend on each other. We will learn how to do that in a later tutorial. Your file should look something like this: #!/bin/bash # Set a name for the job (-J or --job-name). #SBATCH --job-name=tutorial # Set the file to write the stdout and stderr to (if -e is not set; -o or --output). #SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.log # Set the number of cores (-n or --ntasks). #SBATCH --ntasks=8 # Force allocation of the two cores on ONE node. #SBATCH --nodes=1 # Set the total memory.

Note that sbatch only tells you that the job has started, but nothing about finishing. You won't get any response at the terminal when the job finishes. It will take approximately 20 minutes to finish the job. Monitoring Jobs \u00b6 You'll probably want to see how your job is doing. You can get a list of your jobs using: (first-steps) $ squeue --me Note that logins are also considered as jobs. Identify your job by the <JOBID> (1 st column) or the name of the script (3 rd column). The most likely states you will see (5 th column of the table): PD pending, waiting to be submitted R running disappeared, either because of an error or because it finished In the 8 th column you can see that your job is very likely running on a different machine than the one you are on! Get more information about your jobs by either passing the job id: (first-steps) $ sstat <JOBID> And of course, watch what the logs are telling you: (first-steps) $ tail -f logs/tutorial-<JOBID>.log There will be no notification when your job is done, so it is best to watch the squeue --me command. To watch the sbatch command there is a linux command watch that you give a command to execute every few seconds. This is useful for looking for changes in the output of a command. The seconds between two executions can be set with the -n option. It is best to use -n 60 to minimize unnecessary load on the file system: (first-steps) $ watch -n 60 squeue --me If for some reason your job is hanging, you can delete your job using scancel with your job-ID: (first-steps) $ scancel <job-ID> Job Queues \u00b6 The cluster has a special way of organizing itself and by telling the cluster how long and with which priority you want your jobs to run, you can help it in this. There is a system set up on the cluster where you can enqueue your jobs to so-called partitions . partitions have different prioritites and are allowed for different running times. To get to know what partitions are available, and how to use them properly, we highly encourage you to read the cluster queues wiki page .","title":"Episode 2"},{"location":"first-steps/episode-2/#first-steps-episode-2","text":"Episode Topic 0 How can I install the tools? 1 How can I use the static data? 2 How can I distribute my jobs on the cluster (Slurm)? 3 How can I organize my jobs with Snakemake? 4 How can I combine Snakemake and Slurm?

In this episode we will discuss how we can parallelize steps in a pipeline that are not dependent on each other. In the last episode we saw a case (the variant calling) that could have been potentially parallelized. We will take care of that today. Please note that we are not going to use the sbatch command we learned earlier. Thus, this tutorial will run on the same node where you execute the script. We will introduce you to Snakemake, a tool with which we can model dependencies and run things in parallel. In the next tutorial we will learn how to submit the jobs with sbatch and Snakemake combined. For those who know make already, Snakemake will be familiar. You can think of Snakemake being a bunch of dedicated bash scripts that you can make dependent on each other. Snakemake will start the next script when a previous one finishes, and potentially it will run things in parallel if the dependencies allow. Snakemake can get confusing, especially if the project gets big. This tutorial will only cover the very basics of this powerful tool. For more, we highly recommend digging into the Snakemake documentation: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ http://slides.com/johanneskoester/deck-1#/ Every Snakemake run requires a Snakefile file. Create a new folder inside your tutorial folder and copy the skeleton: (first-steps) $ mkdir -p /fast/users/${USER}/work/tutorial/episode3 (first-steps) $ pushd /fast/users/${USER}/work/tutorial/episode3 (first-steps) $ cp /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/Snakefile . (first-steps) $ chmod u+w Snakefile Your Snakefile should look as follows: rule all : input : 'snps/test.vcf' , 'structural_variants/test.vcf' rule alignment : input : '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R1.fq.gz' , '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R2.fq.gz' , output : bam = 'alignment/test.bam' , bai = 'alignment/test.bam.bai' , shell : r \"\"\" export TMPDIR=/fast/users/${{USER}}/scratch/tmp mkdir -p ${{TMPDIR}} BWAREF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/precomputed/BWA/0.7.17/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta bwa mem -t 8 \\ -R \"@RG\\tID:FLOWCELL.LANE\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tLB:test\\tSM:PA01\" \\ ${{BWAREF}} \\ {input} \\ | samtools view -b - \\ | samtools sort -O BAM -T ${{TMPDIR}} -o {output.bam} samtools index {output.bam} \"\"\" rule structural_variants : input : 'alignment/test.bam' output : 'structural_variants/test.vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta delly call -o {output} -g ${{REF}} {input} \"\"\" rule snps : input : 'alignment/test.bam' output : 'snps/test.vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta gatk HaplotypeCaller \\ -R ${{REF}} \\ -I {input} \\ -ploidy 2 \\ -O {output} \"\"\" Let me explain. The content resembles the same steps we took in the previous tutorials. Although every step has its own rule (alignment, snp calling, structural variant calling), we could instead have written everything in one rule. It is up to you to design your rules! Note that the rule names are arbitrary and not mentioned anywhere else in the file. But there is one primary rule: the rule all . This is the kickoff rule that makes everything run. As you might have noticed, every rule has three main parameters: input , output and shell . input defines the files that are going into the rule, output those that are produced when executing the rule, and shell is the bash script that processes input to produce output . Rule all does not have any output or shell , it uses input to start the chain of rules. Note that the input files of this rule are the output files of rule snps and structural_variants . The input of those rules is the output of rule alignment . This is how Snakemake processes the rules: It looks for rule all (or a rule that just has input files) and figures out how it can create the required input files with other rules by looking at their output files (the input files of one rule must be the output files of another rule). In our case it traces the workflow back to rule snps and structural_variants as they have the matching output files. They depend in return on the alignment, so the alignment rule must be executed, and this is the first thing that will be done by Snakemake. There are also some peculiarities about Snakemake: You can name files in input or output as is done in rule alignment with the output files. You can access the input and output files in the script by writing {input} or {output} . If they are not named, they will be concatenated, separated by white space If they are named, access them with their name, e.g., {output.bam} Curly braces must be escaped with curly braces, e.g., for bash variables: ${{VAR}} instead of ${VAR} but not Snakemake internal variables like {input} or {output} In the rule structural_variants we cheat a bit because delly does not produce output files if it can't find variants. We do this by touching (i.e., creating) the required output file. Snakemake has a function for doing so (call touch() on the filename). Intermediate folders in the path to output files are always created if they don't exist. Because Snakemake is Python based, you can write your own functions for it to use, e.g. for creating file names automatically. But Snakemake can do more. It is able to parse the paths of the output files and set wildcards if you want. For this your input (and output) file names have to follow a parsable scheme. In our case they do! Our FASTQ files, our only initial input files, start with test . The output of the alignment as well as the variant calling is also prefixed test . We now can modify the Snakemake file accordingly, by exchanging every occurrence of test in each input or output field with {id} (note that you could also give a different name for your variable). Only the input rule should not be touched, otherwise Snakemake would not know which value this variable should have. Your Snakefile should look now like this: rule all : input : 'snps/test.vcf' , 'structural_variants/test.vcf' rule alignment : input : l '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/ {id} _R1.fq.gz' , '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/ {id} _R2.fq.gz' , output : bam = 'alignment/ {id} .bam' , bai = 'alignment/ {id} .bam.bai' , shell : r \"\"\" export TMPDIR=/fast/users/${{USER}}/scratch/tmp mkdir -p ${{TMPDIR}} BWAREF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/precomputed/BWA/0.7.17/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta bwa mem -t 8 \\ -R \"@RG\\tID:FLOWCELL.LANE\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tLB:test\\tSM:PA01\" \\ ${{BWAREF}} \\ {input} \\ | samtools view -b - \\ | samtools sort -O BAM -T ${{TMPDIR}} -o {output.bam} samtools index {output.bam} \"\"\" rule structural_variants : input : 'alignment/ {id} .bam' output : 'structural_variants/ {id} .vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta delly call -o {output} -g ${{REF}} {input} \"\"\" rule snps : input : 'alignment/ {id} .bam' output : 'snps/ {id} .vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta gatk HaplotypeCaller \\ -R ${{REF}} \\ -I {input} \\ -ploidy 2 \\ -O {output} \"\"\" Before we finally run this, we can make a dry run.

In this episode we will discuss how we can parallelize steps in a pipeline that are not dependent on each other. In the last episode we saw a case (the variant calling) that could have been potentially parallelized. We will take care of that today. Please note that we are not going to use the sbatch command we learned earlier. Thus, this tutorial will run on the same node where you execute the script. We will introduce you to Snakemake, a tool with which we can model dependencies and run things in parallel. In the next tutorial we will learn how to submit the jobs with sbatch and Snakemake combined. For those who know make already, Snakemake will be familiar. You can think of Snakemake being a bunch of dedicated bash scripts that you can make dependent on each other. Snakemake will start the next script when a previous one finishes, and potentially it will run things in parallel if the dependencies allow. Snakemake can get confusing, especially if the project gets big. This tutorial will only cover the very basics of this powerful tool. For more, we highly recommend digging into the Snakemake documentation: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ http://slides.com/johanneskoester/deck-1#/ Every Snakemake run requires a Snakefile file. Create a new folder inside your tutorial folder and copy the skeleton: (first-steps) $ mkdir -p /fast/users/${USER}/work/tutorial/episode3 (first-steps) $ pushd /fast/users/${USER}/work/tutorial/episode3 (first-steps) $ cp /fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/skeletons/Snakefile . (first-steps) $ chmod u+w Snakefile Your Snakefile should look as follows: rule all : input : 'snps/test.vcf' , 'structural_variants/test.vcf' rule alignment : input : '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R1.fq.gz' , '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/test_R2.fq.gz' , output : bam = 'alignment/test.bam' , bai = 'alignment/test.bam.bai' , shell : r \"\"\" export TMPDIR=/fast/users/${{USER}}/scratch/tmp mkdir -p ${{TMPDIR}} BWAREF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/precomputed/BWA/0.7.17/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta bwa mem -t 8 \\ -R \"@RG\\tID:FLOWCELL.LANE\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tLB:test\\tSM:PA01\" \\ ${{BWAREF}} \\ {input} \\ | samtools view -b - \\ | samtools sort -O BAM -T ${{TMPDIR}} -o {output.bam} samtools index {output.bam} \"\"\" rule structural_variants : input : 'alignment/test.bam' output : 'structural_variants/test.vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta delly call -o {output} -g ${{REF}} {input} \"\"\" rule snps : input : 'alignment/test.bam' output : 'snps/test.vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta gatk HaplotypeCaller \\ -R ${{REF}} \\ -I {input} \\ -ploidy 2 \\ -O {output} \"\"\" Let me explain. The content resembles the same steps we took in the previous tutorials. Although every step has its own rule (alignment, snp calling, structural variant calling), we could instead have written everything in one rule. It is up to you to design your rules! Note that the rule names are arbitrary and not mentioned anywhere else in the file. But there is one primary rule: the rule all . This is the kickoff rule that makes everything run. As you might have noticed, every rule has three main parameters: input , output and shell . input defines the files that are going into the rule, output those that are produced when executing the rule, and shell is the bash script that processes input to produce output . Rule all does not have any output or shell , it uses input to start the chain of rules. Note that the input files of this rule are the output files of rule snps and structural_variants . The input of those rules is the output of rule alignment . This is how Snakemake processes the rules: It looks for rule all (or a rule that just has input files) and figures out how it can create the required input files with other rules by looking at their output files (the input files of one rule must be the output files of another rule). In our case it traces the workflow back to rule snps and structural_variants as they have the matching output files. They depend in return on the alignment, so the alignment rule must be executed, and this is the first thing that will be done by Snakemake. There are also some peculiarities about Snakemake: You can name files in input or output as is done in rule alignment with the output files. You can access the input and output files in the script by writing {input} or {output} . If they are not named, they will be concatenated, separated by white space If they are named, access them with their name, e.g., {output.bam} Curly braces must be escaped with curly braces, e.g., for bash variables: ${{VAR}} instead of ${VAR} but not Snakemake internal variables like {input} or {output} In the rule structural_variants we cheat a bit because delly does not produce output files if it can't find variants. We do this by touching (i.e., creating) the required output file. Snakemake has a function for doing so (call touch() on the filename). Intermediate folders in the path to output files are always created if they don't exist. Because Snakemake is Python based, you can write your own functions for it to use, e.g. for creating file names automatically. But Snakemake can do more. It is able to parse the paths of the output files and set wildcards if you want. For this your input (and output) file names have to follow a parsable scheme. In our case they do! Our FASTQ files, our only initial input files, start with test . The output of the alignment as well as the variant calling is also prefixed test . We now can modify the Snakemake file accordingly, by exchanging every occurrence of test in each input or output field with {id} (note that you could also give a different name for your variable). Only the input rule should not be touched, otherwise Snakemake would not know which value this variable should have. Your Snakefile should look now like this: rule all : input : 'snps/test.vcf' , 'structural_variants/test.vcf' rule alignment : input : l '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/ {id} _R1.fq.gz' , '/fast/projects/cubit/work/tutorial/input/ {id} _R2.fq.gz' , output : bam = 'alignment/ {id} .bam' , bai = 'alignment/ {id} .bam.bai' , shell : r \"\"\" export TMPDIR=/fast/users/${{USER}}/scratch/tmp mkdir -p ${{TMPDIR}} BWAREF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/precomputed/BWA/0.7.17/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta bwa mem -t 8 \\ -R \"@RG\\tID:FLOWCELL.LANE\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tLB:test\\tSM:PA01\" \\ ${{BWAREF}} \\ {input} \\ | samtools view -b - \\ | samtools sort -O BAM -T ${{TMPDIR}} -o {output.bam} samtools index {output.bam} \"\"\" rule structural_variants : input : 'alignment/ {id} .bam' output : 'structural_variants/ {id} .vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta delly call -o {output} -g ${{REF}} {input} \"\"\" rule snps : input : 'alignment/ {id} .bam' output : 'snps/ {id} .vcf' shell : r \"\"\" REF=/fast/projects/cubit/current/static_data/reference/GRCh37/g1k_phase1/human_g1k_v37.fasta gatk HaplotypeCaller \\ -R ${{REF}} \\ -I {input} \\ -ploidy 2 \\ -O {output} \"\"\" Before we finally run this, we can make a dry run.

In the last episodes we learned about distributing a job among the cluster nodes using sbatch and how to automate and parallelize our pipeline with Snakemake. We are lucky that those two powerful commands can be combined. What is the result? You will have an automated pipeline with Snakemake that uses sbatch to distribute jobs among the cluster nodes instead of running only the same node.

The aim is to gather the information for using the cluster efficiently and helping common issues andproblems. Where can I get help? \u00b6 First, contact bih-cluster@charite.de with your question. Here, administrators, CUBI, and other users alike are subscribed and can answer your question. For problems while connecting and logging in, please contact helpdesk@mdc-berlin.de or helpdesk@charite.de . For problems with BIH HPC please contact [ hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de ]. I cannot connect to the cluster. What's wrong? \u00b6 Please see the section Connection Problems . I'd like to learn more about Slurm \u00b6 Some documentation is available on this website, e.g., start at Slurm Quickstart . What is the difference between MAX and BIH cluster? What is their relation? \u00b6 What is the difference between MAX and BIH clusters? What is their relation? \u00b6 Administrativa The BIH clusters are the cluster of the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and is located in Buch and operated by BIH HPC IT. The cluster is open for users of both BIH/Charite and MDC. The MAX cluster is the cluster of the Max Delbrueck Center (MDC) in Buch. This cluster is used by the researchers at MDC and integrates a lot of infrastructure of the MDC. Request for both systems are handled separately, depending on the user's affiliation with research/service groups. Hardware and Systems Both clusters consist of similar hardware for the compute nodes and both feature a DDN system at different number of nodes and different storage volume. Both clusters run CentOS but at potentially different version. BIH HPC uses the Slurm workload manager whereas MAX uses Univa Grid Engine. The BIH cluster has a significantly faster internal network (40GB/s optical). Bioinformatics Software On the BIH cluster, users can install their own (bioinformatics) software in their user directory. On the MAX cluster, users can also install their own software or use software provided by Altuna Akalin's group at MDC . My SSH sessions break with \" packet_write_wait: Connection to XXX : Broken pipe \". How can I fix this? \u00b6 Try to put the following line at the top of your ~/.ssh/config . ServerAliveInterval 30 This will make ssh send an empty network package to the server. This will prevent network hardware from thinking your connection is unused/broken and terminating it. If the problem persists, please report it to hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de . My job terminated before being done. What happened? \u00b6 First of all, look into your job logs. In the case that the job was terminated by Slurm (e.g., because it ran too long), you will find a message like this at the bottom. Please look at the end of the last line in your log file. slurmstepd: error: *** JOB <your job id> ON med0xxx CANCELLED AT 2020-09-02T21:01:12 DUE TO TIME LIMIT *** This indicates that you need to need to adjust the --time limit to your sbatch command. slurmstepd: error: Detected 2 oom-kill event(s) in step <your job id>.batch cgroup. Some of your processes may have been killed by the cgroup out-of-memory handler This indicates that your job tries to use more memory than has been allocated to it. Also see Slurm Scheduler: Memory Allocation Otherwise, you can use sacct -j JOBID to read the information that the job accounting system has recorded for your job. A job that was canceled (indicated by CANCELED ) by the Slurm job scheduler looks like this (ignore the COMPLETED step that is just some post-job step added by Slurm automatically). # sacct -j _JOBID_ JobID JobName Partition Account AllocCPUS State ExitCode ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- _JOBID_ snakejob.+ medium hpc-ag-xx+ 4 TIMEOUT 0:0 _JOBID_.bat+ batch hpc-ag-xx+ 4 CANCELLED 0:15 _JOBID_.ext+ extern hpc-ag-xx+ 4 COMPLETED 0:0 Use the --long flag to see all fields (and probably pipe it into less as: sacct -j JOBID --long | less -S ). Things to look out for: What is the exit code? Is the highest recorded memory usage too high/higher than expected (field MaxRSS )? Is the running time too long/longer than expected (field Elapsed )? Note that --long does not show all fields. For example, the following tells us that the given job was above its elapsed time which caused it to be killed. # sacct -j _JOBID_ --format Timelimit,Elapsed Timelimit Elapsed ---------- ---------- 01:00:00 01:00:12 01:00:13 01:00:12 Use man sacct , sacct --helpformat , or see the Slurm Documentation for options for the --format field of sacct .

In this case, please send an email to hpc-admin@bihealth.de and request a new project. I have a problem with my SSH key, help! \u00b6 Please contact MDC Helpdesk for help. CUBI is also only a user on the BIH cluster and has no access to the user, password, or SSH keys registries. I have a problem with logging into the cluster, help! \u00b6 See \"I have a problem with my SSH key, help!\" I cannot create PNGs in R \u00b6 For using the png method, you need to have an X11 session running. This might be the case if you logged into a cluster node using srun --x11 if configured correctly but is not the case if you submitted a bash job. The solution is to use xvfb-run (xvfb = X11 virtual frame-buffer). Here is the content of an example script: $ cat img.R #!/usr/bin/env Rscript png('cars.png') cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9) plot(cars) dev.off() Here, it fails without X11: $ ./img.R Error in .External2(C_X11, paste(\"png::\", filename, sep = \"\"), g$width, : unable to start device PNG Calls: png In addition: Warning message: In png(\"cars.png\") : unable to open connection to X11 display '' Execution halted Here, it works with xvfb-run : $ xvfb-run ./img.R null device 1 $ ls cars.png foo.png img.R Rplots.pdf My jobs don't get scheduled \u00b6 You can use scontrol show job JOBID to get the details displayed about your jobs.

My jobs don't run in the partition I expect \u00b6 You can see the partition that your job runs in with squeue -j JOBID : res-login-1:~$ squeue -j 877092 JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES NODELIST ( REASON ) 877092 medium snakejob holtgrem R 0 :05 1 med0626 See Job Scheduler for information about the partition's properties and how jbos are routed to partitions. You can force jobs to run in a particular partition by specifying the --partition parameter, e.g., by adding --partition=medium or -p medium to your srun and sbatch calls. My jobs get killed after four hours \u00b6 This is probably answered by the answer to My jobs don't run in the partition I expect . How can I mount a network volume from elsewhere on the cluster? \u00b6 You cannot. Also see the For the Impatient section of the manual. Why can I not mount a network volume from elsewhere on the cluster? \u00b6 For performance and stability reasons. Network volumes are notorious for degrading performance, depending on the used protocol, even stability. How can I then access the files from my workstation/server? \u00b6 HPC 4 Research You can transfer files to the cluster through Rsync over SSH or through SFTP to the transfer-1 or transfer-2 node. HPC 4 Clinic We are currently working on a solution to this. Please contact hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de in case of any questions. Do not transfer files through the login nodes. Large file transfers through the login nodes can cause performance degradation for the users with interactive SSH connections. How can I circumvent \"invalid instruction\" (signal 4) errors? \u00b6 Make sure that software is compiled with \"sandy bridge\" optimizations and no later one. E.g., use the -march=sandybridge argument to the GCC/LLVM compiler executables. If you absolutely need it, there are some boxes with more recent processors in the cluster (e.g., Haswell architecture). Look at the /proc/cpuinfo files for details. Where should my (Mini)conda install go? \u00b6 As conda installations are big and contain many files, they should go into your work directory. E.g., /fast/users/$USER/work/miniconda is appropriate. I have problems connecting to the GPU node! What's wrong? \u00b6 Please check whether there might be other jobs waiting in front of you! The following squeue call will show the allocated GPUs of jobs in the gpu queue. This is done by specifying a format string and using the %b field. squeue -o \"%.10i %9P %20j %10u %.2t %.10M %.6D %10R %b\" -p gpu JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES NODELIST ( R TRES_PER_NODE 872571 gpu bash user1 R 15 :53:25 1 med0303 gpu:tesla:1 862261 gpu bash user2 R 2 -16:26:59 1 med0304 gpu:tesla:4 860771 gpu kidney.job user3 R 2 -16:27:12 1 med0302 gpu:tesla:1 860772 gpu kidney.job user3 R 2 -16:27:12 1 med0302 gpu:tesla:1 860773 gpu kidney.job user3 R 2 -16:27:12 1 med0302 gpu:tesla:1 860770 gpu kidney.job user3 R 4 -03:23:08 1 med0301 gpu:tesla:1 860766 gpu kidney.job user3 R 4 -03:23:11 1 med0303 gpu:tesla:1 860767 gpu kidney.job user3 R 4 -03:23:11 1 med0301 gpu:tesla:1 860768 gpu kidney.job user3 R 4 -03:23:11 1 med0301 gpu:tesla:1 In the example above, user1 has one job with one GPU running on med0303, user2 has one job running with 4 GPUs on med0304 and user3 has 7 jobs in total running of different machines with one GPU each. How can I access graphical user interfaces (such as for Matlab) on the cluster? \u00b6 First of all, you will need an X(11) server on your local machine (see Wikipedia: X Window System . This server offers a \"graphical surface\" that the programs on the cluster can then paint on. You need to make sure that the programs running on the cluster can access this graphical surface. Generally, you need to connect to the login nodes with X forwarding. Refer to the manual of your SSH client on how to do this ( -X for Linux/Mac ssh As you should not run compute-intensive programs on the login node, connect to a cluster node with X forwarding. With Slurm, this is done using srun --pty --x11 bash -i (instead of srun --pty --x11 bash -i ). Also see: Running graphical(X11) applications on Windows Running graphical(X11) applications on Linux How can I log into a node outside of the scheduler? \u00b6 This is sometimes useful, e.g., for monitoring the CPU/GPU usage of your job interactively. No Computation Outside of Slurm Do not perform any computation outside of the scheduler as (1) this breaks the purpose of the scheduling system and (2) administration is not aware and might kill you jobs. The answer is simple, just SSH into this node. res-login-1:~$ ssh med0XXX Snakemake DRMAA doesn't accept my Slurm parameters!? \u00b6 Yes. Unfortunately, Slurm DRMAA differs slightly from the original Slurm syntax. Why am I getting multiple nodes to my job? \u00b6 Classically, jobs on HPC systems are written in a way that they can run on multiple nodes at once, using the network to communicate. Slurm comes from this world and when allocating more than one CPU/core, it might allocate them on different nodes. Please use --nodes=1 to force Slurm to allocate them on a single node. How can I select a certain CPU architecture? \u00b6 You can select the CPU architecture by using the -C / --constraint flag to sbatch and srun . The following are available (as detected by the Linux kernel): ivybridge (96 nodes, plus 4 high-memory nodes) haswell (16 nodes) broadwell (112 nodes) skylake (16 nodes, plus 4 GPU nodes) You can specify contraints with OR such as --constraint=haswell|broadwell|skylake . You can see the assignment of architectures to nodes using the sinfo -o \"%8P %.5a %.10l %.6D %.6t %10f %N\" command. This will also display node partition, availability etc. Help, I'm getting a Quota Warning Email! \u00b6 No worries! As documented in the Storage Locations section, each user/project/group has three storage volumes: A small home , a larger work and a large (but temporary) scratch . There are limits on the size of these volumes. You get a nightly warning email in case you are over the soft limit and you will not be able to write any more data if you get above the hard limit. When you login to the login nodes, the quotas and current usage is displayed to you. Please note that not all files will be displayed when using ls . You have to add the -a parameter to also show files and directory starting with a dot. Often, users are confused if these dot directories take up all of their home quota. Use the following command to list all files and directories in your home: res-login-1:~$ ls -la ~/ You can use the following command to see how space each item takes up, including the hidden directories res-login-1:~$ du -shc ~/.* ~/* --exclude = .. --exclude = . In the case that, e.g., the .cpan directory is large, you can move it to work and create a symlink in its original place. res-login-1:~$ mv ~/.cpan ~/work/.cpan res-login-1:~$ ln -sr ~/work/.cpan ~/.cpan Environment modules don't work and I get \"module: command not found\" \u00b6 First of all, ensure that you are on a compute node and not on one of the login nodes. One common reason is that the system-wide Bash configuration has not been loaded, try to execute source /etc/bashrc and then re-try using module . In the case that the problem persists, please contact hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de . What should my ~/.bashrc look like? \u00b6 All users get their home directory setup using a skelleton files. These file names start with a dot . and are hidden when you type ls , you have to type ls -a to see them. You can find the current skelleton in /etc/skel.bih and inspect the content of the Bash related files as follows: res-login-1:~$ head /etc/skel.bih/.bash* == > /etc/skel.bih/.bash_logout < == # ~/.bash_logout == > /etc/skel.bih/.bash_profile < == # .bash_profile # Get the aliases and functions if [ -f ~/.bashrc ] ; then . ~/.bashrc fi # User specific environment and startup programs PATH = $PATH : $HOME /.local/bin: $HOME /bin == > /etc/skel.bih/.bashrc < == # .bashrc # Source global definitions if [ -f /etc/bashrc ] ; then . /etc/bashrc fi # Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's auto-paging feature: # export SYSTEMD_PAGER= There actually are a couple of more files by default. The original copy in `/etc/skel.bih`` might slightly change over time during improvements but we will not touch your home directory in an unsolicited way at any time! res-login-1:~$ tree -a /etc/skel.bih/ /etc/skel.bih/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .bash_logout \u251c\u2500\u2500 .bash_profile \u251c\u2500\u2500 .bashrc \u251c\u2500\u2500 .screenrc \u2514\u2500\u2500 .vimrc My program crashes! What should I do? \u00b6 Have a look at our How-To: Debug Software and How-To: Debug Software on HPC Systems guides! But it works on my workstation! Yes, please also refer to these guides on possible approaches to find the problem. Which CUDA version is installed? \u00b6 For this, connect to the node you want to query (via SSH but do not perform any computation via SSH!) res-login-1:~$ ssh med0301 med0301:~$ yum list installed 2 >/dev/null | grep cuda.x86_64 cuda.x86_64 10 .2.89-1 @local-cuda nvidia-driver-latest-dkms-cuda.x86_64 3 :440.64.00-1.el7 @local-cuda Can I use Docker on the Cluster? \u00b6 No, as Docker essentially gives you access as the root user. However, you can use Singularity to run containers (and even many Docker contains if they are \"properly built\"). Also see Using Singularity (with Docker Images) . How can I copy data between the MAX Cluster (MDC Network) and BIH HPC? \u00b6 The MAX cluster is the HPC system of the MDC. It is located in the MDC network. The BIH HPC is located in the BIH network. In general, connections can only be initiated from the MDC network to the BIH network. The reverse does not work. In other words, you have to log into the MAX cluster and then initiate your file copies to or from the BIH HPC from there. E.g., use rsync -avP some/path user_m@transfer-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org:/another/path to copy files from the MAX cluster to BIH HPC and rsync -avP user_m@transfer-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org:/another/path some/path to copy data from the BIH HPC to the MAX cluster. How can I copy data between the Charite Network and BIH HPC? \u00b6 In general, connections can only be initiated from the Charite network to the BIH network. The reverse does not work. In other words, you have to be on a machine inside the Charite network and then initiate your file copies to or from the BIH HPC from there. E.g., use rsync -avP some/path user_c@transfer-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org:/another/path to copy files from the MAX cluster to BIH HPC and rsync -avP user_c@transfer-1.research.hpc.bihealth.org:/another/path some/path to copy data from the BIH HPC to the MAX cluster. My jobs are slow/die on the login/transfer node! \u00b6 As of December 3, 2020 we have established a policy to limit you to 512 files and 128MB of RAM. Further, you are limited to using the equivalent of one core. This limit is enforced for all processes originating from an SSH session and the limit is enforced on all jobs. This was done to prevent users from thrashing the head nodes or using SSH based sessions for computation. How can I share files/collaborate with users from another work group? \u00b6 Please use projects as documented here .

HPC 4 Clinic The cluster has three nodes with four Tesla V100 GPUs each: cc-node0[24-26] . Connecting to a node with GPUs is easy. You simply request a GPU using the --gres=gpu:tesla:COUNT argument to srun and batch . This will automatically place your job in the gpu partition (which is where the GPU nodes live) and allocate a number of COUNT GPUs to your job. Hint Make sure to read the FAQ entry \" I have problems connecting to the GPU node! What's wrong? \". Interactive Use of GPU Nodes is Discouraged While interactive computation on the GPU nodes is convenient, it makes it very easy to forget a job after your computation is complete and let it run idle. While your job is allocated, it blocks the allocated GPUs and other users cannot use them although you might not be actually using them. Please prefer batch jobs for your GPU jobs over interactive jobs. Further, interactive GPU jobs are currently limited to 24 hours. We will monitor the situation and adjust that limit to optimize GPU usage and usability. Allocation of GPUs through Slurm is mandatory In other word: using GPUs from SSH sessions is prohibited. The scheduler is not aware of manually allocated GPUs and this interferes with other users' jobs. Prequisites \u00b6 You have to register with hpc-gatekeeper@bihealth.de for requesting access. Afterwards, you can connect to the GPU nodes as shown below. Preparation \u00b6 We will setup a miniconda installation with pytorch testing the GPU. If you already have this setup then you can skip this step res-login-1:~$ srun --pty bash med0703:~$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh med0703:~$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/miniconda3 med0703:~$ source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate med0703:~$ conda create -y -n gpu-test pytorch cudatoolkit = 10 .2 -c pytorch med0703:~$ conda activate gpu-test med0703:~$ python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())' False med0703:~$ exit res-login-1:~$ The False shows that CUDA is not available on the node but that is to be expected.

This guide is far from complete. Please feel free to contribute, e.g., refer to How-To: Contribute to this Document . Please make sure that you have read How-To: Debug Software as a general primer. As debugging is hard enough already, it makes one wonder how to do this on the HPC system in batch mode. Here is a list of pointers. Attempt 1: Run it interactively! \u00b6 First of all, you can of course get an interactive session using srun --pty bash -i and then run your program interactively. Make sure to allocate appropriate memory and cores for your purpose. You might also want to first start a screen or tmux session on the login node such that network interruptions to the login node don't harm your hard debugging work! Does the program work correctly if you do this? If yes, and it only fails when run in batch mode, consider the following behaviour of the scheduler. The scheduler takes your resource requirements and tries to find a free slot. Once it has found a free slot, it will attempt to run the program. This mainly differs in running it interactively in standard input, output, and error streams. By default, stdin is connected to /dev/null such that no input is read. You can change this with the --input= flag to specify a file. By default stdout and stderr are joint and written to the file specified as --output= . You can use certain wildcards to make the output (but also the input files) depend on things like the job ID or job name. Please note that the directory name to the output file but exist before the job is launched. It is not sufficient to mkdir it in the job script itself. Please refer to the sbatch documentation for details. If your program fails without leaving any log file or any other trace, make sure that the path to the output file exists. To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no way to tell apart a crash because this does not exist and a program failure (except maybe for the running time of 0 seconds and memory usage of 0 bytes). Attempt 2: Inspect the logs \u00b6 Do you see any exception in your log files? If not, continue. If your job is canceled by scancel or stopped because it exhausted it maximal running time or allocated resources then you will find a note in the last line of your error output log (usually folded into the standard output). Please note that if the previous output line did not include a line ending, the message might be at the very end of the last line. The message will look similar to: slurmstepd: error: *** JOB <your job id> ON med0xxx CANCELLED AT 2020-09-02T21:01:12 DUE TO TIME LIMIT *** Attempt 3: Increase logging/printing \u00b6 Ideally, you can add one or more --verbose / -v flags to your program to increase verbosity. See how far your program gets, see where it fails. This attempt will be greatly helped by reproducible running on a minimal working example. Attempt 4: Use sattach \u00b6 You can use sattach for attaching your terminal to your running job. This way, you can perform an interactive inspection of the commands. You can combine this with one of the next attempst of using debuggers to e.g., get an pdb debugger at an important position of your program. However, please note that pdb and ipdb will stop the program's execution if the standard input stream is at end of file (which /dev/null is and this is used by default in sbatch jobs). Attempt 5: Inspect Program Activity \u00b6 Log into the node that your program runs on either using srun --pty --nodelist=NODE or using ssh . Please note that you should never perform computational intensive things when logging into the node directly. You can then use all activity inspection tips from How-To: Debug Software . Attempt 6: Use Debuggers \u00b6 After having logged into the node running your program, you can of course also attach to the program with gdb -p PID or cgdb -p PID .

Chances are that you are just overlooking something obvious which is actually easy to fix. Keep old log files! Really, really, make sure that your program runs deterministically.

Please feel free to contribute, e.g., refer to How-To: Contribute to this Document . Software development in general or even debugging of software are very broad topics. As such, we will not be able to handle them here comprehensively. Rather, we will give a tour de force on practical and minimal approaches of debugging of software. Here, debugging refers to the process of locating errors in your program and removing them. Origin of the term debugging The terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However, the term \"bug\", in the sense of \"technical error\", dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion). -- Wikipedia: Debugging When forgetting a moment about everything known about software engineering, programming roughly work sin the following cycle: You run your program. In the case of failure, you need to remove the problem until the program runs through. You then start implementing the next change or feature. But how do you actually locate the problem? Let us walk through a couple of steps. Step 1: Find out that there is an error \u00b6 This might seem trivial but let us think about this for a moment. For this you will have to run your program on some input and observe its behaviour and output, you will need to have an expectation of its behaviour and output, and observe unexpected behaviour, including but not limited to: the program crashes, the program produce wrong or corrupted output, or the program produces incomplete output. You could make this step a bit more comfortable by writing a little checker script that compares expected and actual output. Step 2: Reproduce your error \u00b6 You will have to find out how often or regularly the problem occurs. Does the problem occur on all inputs or only specific ones? Does it occur with all parameters? Make sure that you can reproduce the problem, otherwise the problem will be hard to track down. Discard randomness In most applications, true randomness is neither required nor used in programs. Rather, pseudo random number generators are used that are usually seeded with a special value. In many cases, the current time is used which makes it hard to reproduce problems. Rather, use a fixed seed, e.g., by calling srand(42) in C. You could also make this a parameter of your program, but make sure that you can fix all pseudo randomness in your program so you can deterministically reproduce its behaviour. Step 3: Create a minimal working example (MWE) \u00b6 Try to find a minimal input set on which you can produce your problem. For example, you could use samtools view FILE.bam chr1:90,000-100,000 to cut out regions from a BAM file. The next step is to nail down the problem. Ideally, you can deactivate or comment out parts of your program that are irrelevant to the problem. This will allow you to get to the problematic point in your program quicker and make the whole debugging exercise easier on yourself. Interlude: What we have up to here \u00b6 We can now tell expected and \"other\" behaviour and output apart (ideally semi-automatically), reproduce the problem, and reproduce the problem quickly. If you reached the points above, you have probably cut the time to resolve the problem by 90% already. Let us now consider a few things that you can do from here to find the source of your problems. Method 1: Stare at your source code \u00b6 Again, this is trivial, but: look at your code and try to follow through what it does with your given input. This is nicely complemented with the following methods. ;-) There is a class of tools to help you in doing this, so-called static code analysis tools. They analyze the source code for problematic patterns. The success and power of such analysis tools tends to corellate strongly with how strictly typed the targeted programming language is. E.g., there are very powerful tools for Java, C/C++. However, there is some useful tool support out there for dynamic languages such as Python. Here is a short list of pointers to static code analysis tools (feel free to extend the list): Python Static Analysis Tools Method 2: Inspect your code's activity \u00b6 Print it! \u00b6 The most simple approach is to use print statements (or similar) to print the current line or value of parameters. While sometimes frowned upon, this certainly is one of the most robust ways to see what is happening in your program. However, beware that too much output might slow down your program or actually make your problem disappear in the case of subtle threading/timing issues (sometimes referred to as \"Heisenbugs\"). Standard output vs. error Classically, Linux/Unix programs can print back to the user's terminal in two ways: standard output and standard errors. By convention, logging should go to stderr. The standard error stream also has the advantage that writing to it has a more direct effect. In contrast to stdout which is usually setup to be (line) buffered (you will only see output after the next newline character), stderr is unbuffered. Look at top / htop \u00b6 The tools top and htop are useful tools for inspecting the activity on the current computer. The following parameters are useful (and are actually also available as key strokes when they are running). -c -- show the programs' command lines -u USER -- show the processes of the user You can exit either tool by pressing q or Ctrl-C . Use the man , Luke! Besides searching the internet for a unix command, you can also read its manual page by running man TOOL . If this does not work, try TOOL --help to see its builtin help function. Also, doing an internet search for \"man tool\" might help. Look at strace \u00b6 The program strace allows you to intercept the calls of your program to the kernel. As the kernel is needed for actions such as accessing the network or file system. Thus this is not so useful if your program gets stuck in \"user land\", but this might be useful to see which files it is accessing. Pro-Tip: if you move the selection line of htop to a process then you can strace the program by pressing s . Look at lsof \u00b6 The lsof program lists all open files with the processes that are accessing them. This is useful for seeing which files you program has opened. You can even build a progress bar with lsof , although that requires sudo privileges which you might not have on the system that you are using. Pro-Tip: if you move the selection line of htop to a process then you can list the open files by pressing l . More looking \u00b6 There are more ways of inspecting your program, here are some: Google Perftools Linux perf Interactive Debuggers \u00b6 Let us now enter the world of interactive debuggers. Integrated development environment (IDEs) generally consist of an editor, a compiler/interpreter, and an ineractive/visual debugger. Usually, they have a debugger program at their core that can also be used on their command line. Old but gold: gdb \u00b6 On Unix systems, a widely used debugger is gdb the GNU debugger. gdb is a command line program and if you are not used to it, it might be hard to use. However, here are some pointers on how to use it: The commands in interactive mode include: quit or Ctrl-D to exit the debugger b file.ext:123 set breakpoint in file.ext on line 123 r run the program p var_name print the value of the variable var_name display var_name print the value of the variable var_name every time execution stops l print the source code around the current line (multiple calls will show the next 10 lines or so, and so on) l 123 print lines around line 123 f show information about the current frame (that is the current source location) bt show the backtrace (that is all functions above the current one) n step to the next line s step into function calls finish run the current function until it returns help to get more help You can call your program directly with command line arguments using cgdb [cgdb-args] --args path/to/program -- [program-args . You can also attach to running programs using cgdb -p PID once you have found out the process ID to attach to using htop or ps`. Pro-tip: use cgdb for an easier to use version that displays the source code in split screen and stores command line histories over sessions. Interactive Python Debuggers \u00b6 You can get a simple REPL (read-execute-print loop) at virtually any position in your program by adding: import pdb ; pdb . set_trace () You will get a prompt at the current position and can issue several commands including: quit or Ctrl-D to exit the debugger p var_name to print the variable with var_name f show information about the current frame (that is the current source location) bt show the backtrace (that is all functions called above the current one) continue to continue running help to get more help Pro-tip: use import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace() (after installing the ipdb package, of course) to get an IPython-based prompt that is much more comfortable to use. Pro-Tip: Version control your code! \u00b6 Here is a free bonus pro-tip: learn how to use version control, e.g., Git. This will allow you to go back to previous versions without problems and see current changes to your source code. 10 Free Online Git Courses Github: Resources to learn Git Pro-Tip: Write automated tests! \u00b6 Combine the pro tip on using version control (learn Git already!) with this one: learn how to write automated tests. This will allow you to quickly narrow down problematic changes in your version control history. Again, testing is another topic alltogether, so here are just some links to testing frameworks to get you started: pytest: testing framework for Python testthat: testing framework for R Reading Material on Debuggers \u00b6 The following web resources can serve as a starting point on how to use debuggers.

This guide is far from complete. Please feel free to contribute, e.g., refer to How-To: Contribute to this Document . Software development in general or even debugging of software are very broad topics. As such, we will not be able to handle them here comprehensively. Rather, we will give a tour de force on practical and minimal approaches of debugging of software. Here, debugging refers to the process of locating errors in your program and removing them. Origin of the term debugging The terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However, the term \"bug\", in the sense of \"technical error\", dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion). -- Wikipedia: Debugging When forgetting a moment about everything known about software engineering, programming roughly work sin the following cycle: You run your program. In the case of failure, you need to remove the problem until the program runs through. You then start implementing the next change or feature. But how do you actually locate the problem? Let us walk through a couple of steps.","title":"How-To: Debug Software"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#step-1-find-out-that-there-is-an-error","text":"This might seem trivial but let us think about this for a moment. For this you will have to run your program on some input and observe its behaviour and output, you will need to have an expectation of its behaviour and output, and observe unexpected behaviour, including but not limited to: the program crashes, the program produce wrong or corrupted output, or the program produces incomplete output. You could make this step a bit more comfortable by writing a little checker script that compares expected and actual output.","title":"Step 1: Find out that there is an error"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#step-2-reproduce-your-error","text":"You will have to find out how often or regularly the problem occurs. Does the problem occur on all inputs or only specific ones? Does it occur with all parameters? Make sure that you can reproduce the problem, otherwise the problem will be hard to track down. Discard randomness In most applications, true randomness is neither required nor used in programs. Rather, pseudo random number generators are used that are usually seeded with a special value. In many cases, the current time is used which makes it hard to reproduce problems. Rather, use a fixed seed, e.g., by calling srand(42) in C. You could also make this a parameter of your program, but make sure that you can fix all pseudo randomness in your program so you can deterministically reproduce its behaviour.","title":"Step 2: Reproduce your error"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#step-3-create-a-minimal-working-example-mwe","text":"Try to find a minimal input set on which you can produce your problem. For example, you could use samtools view FILE.bam chr1:90,000-100,000 to cut out regions from a BAM file. The next step is to nail down the problem. Ideally, you can deactivate or comment out parts of your program that are irrelevant to the problem. This will allow you to get to the problematic point in your program quicker and make the whole debugging exercise easier on yourself.","title":"Step 3: Create a minimal working example (MWE)"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#interlude-what-we-have-up-to-here","text":"We can now tell expected and \"other\" behaviour and output apart (ideally semi-automatically), reproduce the problem, and reproduce the problem quickly.

This is nicely complemented with the following methods. ;-) There is a class of tools to help you in doing this, so-called static code analysis tools. They analyze the source code for problematic patterns. The success and power of such analysis tools tends to corellate strongly with how strictly typed the targeted programming language is. E.g., there are very powerful tools for Java, C/C++. However, there is some useful tool support out there for dynamic languages such as Python.

However, beware that too much output might slow down your program or actually make your problem disappear in the case of subtle threading/timing issues (sometimes referred to as \"Heisenbugs\"). Standard output vs. error Classically, Linux/Unix programs can print back to the user's terminal in two ways: standard output and standard errors. By convention, logging should go to stderr. The standard error stream also has the advantage that writing to it has a more direct effect. In contrast to stdout which is usually setup to be (line) buffered (you will only see output after the next newline character), stderr is unbuffered.","title":"Print it!"},{"location":"how-to/misc/debug-software/#look-at-tophtop","text":"The tools top and htop are useful tools for inspecting the activity on the current computer.

Currently, HPC users cannot use the file box mechanism on their own. BIH HPC IT provides a file exchange server to be used by the BIH core facilities and their users. The server is located in the BIH DMZ in Buch. Users authenticate using their Charite/BIH ( user@CHARITE ) or MDC accounts ( user@MDC-BERLIN ). File exchange is organized using \"file boxes\", directories created on the server to which selected users are granted access. Access control list maintenance is done with audit-trails (\"Revisionssicherheit\") and the file access itself is also logged to comply with data protection standards. Jump to \"From Windows\" Jump to \"From Linux\" Jump to \"From Mac\" Access from Charite Network Access from the Charite network (IP ranges 141.x.x.x and 10.x.x.x ) must connect through the Charite proxy ( http://proxy.charite.de:8080 ). Depending on the client software that you are using, you might have to configure the proxy. File Box Management \u00b6 File boxes are created by the core facilities (e.g., the genomics facilities at Charite and MDC). The facility members also organize the access control. Please talk to your core facility contact on file exchange. External users must obtain a Charite or MDC account first. Account creation is handled by the core facilities that the external user is a customer of. File Access \u00b6 Generally, you will be given a URL to your file box similar to https://file-exchange.bihealth.org/<file-box-id> . The files are served over an encrypted connection using WebDAV (which uses HTTPS). The following describes how to access the files in the box from different platforms. From Linux \u00b6 We describe how to access the files on the command line using the lftp program. The program is preinstalled on the BIH (and the MDC cluster) and you should be able to just install it with yum install lftp on CentOS/Red Hat or apt-get install lftp on Ubuntu/Debian. When using lftp , you have to add some configuration first: # cat >>~/.lftprc <<\"EOF\" set ssl:verify-certificate no set ftp:ssl-force yes EOF In case that you want to access the files using a graphical user interface, search Google for \"WebDAV\" and your operating system or desktop environment. File browsers such as Nautilus and Thunar have built-in WebDAV support. Connecting \u00b6 First, log into the machine that has lftp installed. The login nodes of the BIH cluster do not have it installed but all compute and file transfer nodes have it. Go to the data download location. host:~$ mkdir -p ~/scratch/download_dir host:~$ cd ~/scratch/download_dir Next, start lftp . You can open the connection using open -u <user>@<DOMAIN> https://file-exchange.bihealth.org/<file-box-id> where <user> is your user name, e.g., holtgrem , <domain> is either MDC or CHARITE , and <file-box-id> the file box ID from the URL provided to you. When prompted, use your normal Charite/MDC password to login. host:download_dir$ lftp lftp :~> open -u holtgrem@CHARITE https://file-exchange.bihealth.org/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6 Password: cd ok, cwd = /c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6 lftp holtgrem@CHARITE@file-exchange.bihealth.org:/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6> Browsing Data \u00b6 You can find a full reference of lftp on the lftp man page . You could also use help COMMAND on the lftp prompt. For example, to look at the files of the server for a bit... lftp holtgrem@CHARITE@file-exchange.bihealth.org:/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6> ls drwxr-xr-x -- / drwxr-xr-x -- dir -rw-r--r-- -- file1 lftp holtgrem@CHARITE@file-exchange.bihealth.org:/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6> find ./ ./dir/ ./dir/file2 ./file1 Downloading Data \u00b6 To download all data use mirror , e.g. with -P 4 to use four download threads. lftp holtgrem@CHARITE@file-exchange.bihealth.org:/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6> mirror .

A common error to see is mirror: Fatal error: gnutls_record_recv: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated. . You can just ignore this. Uploading Data \u00b6 To upload data, you can use mirror -R . which is essentially the \"reverse\" of the mirror command. lftp holtgrem@CHARITE@file-exchange.bihealth.org:/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6> mirror -R mirror: Fatal error: gnutls_record_recv: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated. mirror: Fatal error: gnutls_record_recv: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated. mirror: Fatal error: gnutls_record_recv: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated. Total: 2 directories, 3 files, 0 symlinks Modified: 3 files, 0 symlinks 4 errors detected From Windows \u00b6 We recommend to use WinSCP for file transfer. Pre-packaged WinSCP on Charite Workstations. Charite IT has packaged WinSCP and you can install it using Matrix24 Empirum on Windows 10 using these instructions in the Charite intranet . Installing WinSCP yourself. You can obtain it from the WinSCP Download Page . A \"portable\" version is available that comes as a ZIP archive that you just have to extract without an installer. Connecting \u00b6 After starting WinSCP, you will see a window titled Login . Just paste the URL (e.g., https://file-exchange.bihealth.org/c62910b3-c1ba-49a5-81a6-a68f1f15aef6/ ) of the file box into the Host name entry field. In this case, the fields File protocol etc. will be filled automatically. Next, enter your user name as user@CHARITE or user@MDC-BERLIN (the capitalization of the part behind the @ is important). The window should now look similar to the one below. Proxy Configuration on Charite Network If you are on the Charite network then you have to configure the proxy. Otherwise, you have to skip this step. Click Advanced and a window titled Advanced Site Settings will pop up. Here, select Connection / Proxy in the left side. Select HTTP for the Proxy type . Then, enter proxy.charite.de as the Proxy host name and set the Port number to 8080 . The window should nwo look as below. Then, click OK to apply the proxy settings. Finally, click Login . You can now transfer files between the file exchange server and your local computer using drag and drop between WinSCP and your local Windows File Explorer. Alternatively, you can use the two-panel view of WinSCP to transfer files as described here . From Mac \u00b6 For Mac, we you can also use lftp as described above in From Linux . You can find install instructions here online . Proxy Configuration on Charite Network If you are on the Charite network then you must have configured the proxy appropriately. Otherwise, you have to skip this step. You can find them in your System Preference in the Network section, in the Advanced tab of your network (e.g., WiFi ). If you want to use a graphical interface then we recommend the usage of Cyberduck . After starting the program, click Open Connection on the top left, then select WebDAV (HTTPS) and fill out the form as in the following way. Paste the file box URL into the server field and use your login name ( user@CHARITE or user@MDC-BERLIN ) with your usual password. If you need to perform access through a graphical user interface on your Mac, please contact hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.org for support. Security \u00b6 The file exchange server has the fail2ban software installed and configured (Charite, MDC, and BIH IPs are excluded from this). If you are entering your user/password incorrectly for more than 5 times in 10 minutes then your machine will be banned for one hour. This means someone else that has the same IP address from the side of the file exchange server can get you blocked. This can happen if you are in the same home or university network with NAT or if you are behind a proxy. In this case you get a \"connection refused\" error. In this case, try again in one hour.","title":"File Exchange"},{"location":"how-to/service/file-exchange/#how-to-use-file-exchange","text":"Obtaining File Boxes At the moment, file boxes are only available to members of core facilities (e.g., genomics, bioinformatics, or metabolomics) for exchanging files for their collaboration partners.

The information below is still accurate. However, many users find it tricky to get SSH tunnels working correctly. A considerable number of parts is involved and you have to get each step 100% correct. Helpdesk cannot support you in problems with SSH tunnels that are caused by incorrect usage. What is Jupyter \u00b6 Project Jupyter is a networking protocol for interactive computing that allows the user to write and execute code for a high number of different programming languages. The most used client is Jupyter Notebook that can be encountered in various form all over the web. Its basic principle is a document consisting of different cells, each of which contains either code (executed in place) or documentation (written in markdown). This allows one to handily describe the processed workflow. Setup and running Jupyter on the cluster \u00b6 Install Jupyter on the cluster (via conda, by creating a custom environment) med0xxx:~$ conda create -n jupyter jupyter med0xxx:~$ conda activate jupyter (If you want to work in a language other than python, you can install more Jupyter language kernel, see the kernel list ) Now you can start the Jupyter server session (you may want to do this in a screen & srun --pty bash -i session as jupyter keeps running while you are doing computations) med0xxx:~$ jupyter notebook --no-browser Check the port number (usually 8888 ) in the on output and remember it for later: [ I 23 :39:40.860 NotebookApp ] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: [ I 23 :39:40.860 NotebookApp ] http://localhost:8888/ By default, Jupyter will create an access token (a link stated in the output) to protect your notebook against unauthorized access which you have to save and enter in the accessing browser. You can change this to password base authorization via jupyter notebook password . If you are running multiple server on one or more nodes, one can separate them by changing the port number by adding --port=$PORT . Connecting to the Running Session \u00b6 This is slightly trickier as we have to create a SSH connection/tunnel via multiple hubs in between. The easiest is probably to configure your .ssh/config to automatically route your connection via the login-node (and MDC-jail if connecting from outside of the MDC network). You have to add (replace with your $CLUSTER_USER and $MDC_USER ) Host med0* user $CLUSTER_USER ProxyCommand ssh $CLUSTER_USER@login-2.research.hpc.bihealth.org -W %h:%p (and if you are outside of the MDC network): Host login-2.research.hpc.bihealth.org ProxyCommand ssh $MDC_USER@ssh1.mdc-berlin.de -W %h:%p to your ~/.ssh/config (If you have a newer version (7.2+) of SSH installed, you can also use ProxyJump $CLUSTER_USER@login-2.research.hpc.bihealth.org instead of ProxyCommand ... ) See whether this works via i.e. ssh med0110 SSH Key Forwarding Please note that only the login nodes query the central user databases (\"Active Directory Servers\") for keys. The compute nodes themselves are not reachable directly from the outside and use the usual ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This means that you will have to append the content of /.ssh/id_rsa.pub from the source host (your workstation/laptop) to /.ssh/authorized_keys` on the cluster. If you fail to do this then you will be able to login to login-1/login-2 but you will get a password prompt for the compute nodes (i.e., med0XXX). Now you setup a tunnel workstation:~$ ssh -N -f -L 127 .0.0.1:8888:localhost: ${ PORT } med0 ${ NODE } with the port of your server (usually 8888 ) and the cluster node srun has send you to. You should now be able to connect to the Jupyter server via localhost:8888 in your webbrowser (see the note about token and password above) and start using Jupyter. Losing connection \u00b6 It can and will happen that will lose connection, either due to network problems or due to shut-down of your computer. This is not a problem at all and you will not lose data, just reconnect to your session. If your notebooks are also losing connection (you will see a colorful remark in the top right corner), reconnect and click the colorful button. If this does not work, your work is still not lost as all cells that have been executed are automatically saved anyways. Copy all unexecuted cells (those are only saved periodically) and reload the browser page (after reconnecting) with F5 . (you can also open a copy of the notebook in another tab, just be aware that there may be synchronisation problems) Ending a Session \u00b6 There are two independent steps in ending a session: Canceling the SSH tunnel Identify the running SSH process med0xxx:~$ ps aux | grep \" $PORT \" This will give you something like this: user 54 0.0 0.0 43104 784 ?

You don't have to learn or understand the specifics of Gromacs. We use it as an example as there are some actual users on the BIH cluster. However, installing it is out of scope of BIH HPC administration. Gromacs is a good example as it is a sufficiently complex piece of software. Quite some configuration is done on the command line and there is no current software package of it in the common RPM repositories. However, it is quite well-documented and easy to install for scientific software so there is a lot to be learned. Related Documents \u00b6 How-To: Build and Run OpenMPI Programs Steps for Installing Scientific Software \u00b6 We will perform the following step: Download and extract the source of the software Configure the software (i.e., create the actual build system Makefile s) Compile the software Install the software Create environment module files so the software is easy to use Many scientific software packages will have more dependencies. If the dependencies are available as CentOS Core or EPEL packages (such as zlib), HPC IT administration can install them. However, otherwise you will have to install them on their own. Warning Do not perform the compilation on the login nodes but go to a compute node instead. Downloading and Extracting Software \u00b6 This is best done in your scratch directory as we don't have to keep these files around for long. Note that the files in your scratch directory will automatically be removed after 4 weeks. You can also use your work directory here. res-login-1:~$ srun --pty bash -i med0127:~$ mkdir $HOME /scratch/gromacs-install med0127:~$ cd $HOME /scratch/gromacs-install med0127:~$ wget http://ftp.gromacs.org/pub/gromacs/gromacs-2018.3.tar.gz med0127:~$ tar xf gromacs-2018.3.tar.gz med0127:~$ ls gromacs-2018.3 admin cmake COPYING CTestConfig.cmake INSTALL scripts src AUTHORS CMakeLists.txt CPackInit.cmake docs README share tests So far so good! Perform the Configure Step \u00b6 This is the most critical step. Most scientific C/C++ software has a build step and allows for, e.g., disabling and enabling features or setting installation paths. Here, you can configure the software depending on your needs and environment. Also, it is the easiest step to mess up. Gromac's documentation is actually quite good but the author had problems to follow it to the letter. Gromacs recommends to create an MPI and a non-MPI build but the precise way did not work. This installation creates two flavours for Gromacs 2018.3, but in a different way than the Gromacs documentation proposes. First, here is how to configure the non-MPI flavour Gromacs wants a modern compiler, so we load gcc . We will need to note down the precise version we used so later we can load it for running Gromacs with the appropriate libraries. We will install gromacs into $HOME/work/software , which is appropriate for user-installed software, but it could also go into a group or project directory. Note that we install the software into your work directory as software installations are quite large and might go above your home quota. Also, software installations are usually not precious enough to waste resources on snapshots and backups. Also that we force Gromacs to use AVX_256 for SIMD support (Intel sandy bridge architecture) to not get unsupported CPU instruction errors. med0127:~$ module load gcc/7.2.0-0 cmake/3.11.0-0 med0127:~$ module list Currently Loaded Modulefiles: 1 ) gcc/7.2.0-0 2 ) cmake/3.11.0-0 med0127:~$ mkdir gromacs-2018.3-build-nompi med0127:~$ cd gromacs-2018.3-build-nompi med0127:~$ cmake ../gromacs-2018.3 \\ -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW = ON \\ -DGMX_MPI = OFF \\ -DGMX_SIMD = AVX_256 \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = $HOME /work/software/gromacs/2018.3 Second, here is how to configure the MPI flavour. Note that we are also enabling the openmpi module. We will also need the precise version here so we can later load the correct libraries. Note that we install the software into the directory gromacs-mpi but switch off shared library building as recommended by the Gromacs documentation. med0127:~$ module load openmpi/3.1.0-0 med0127:~$ module list Currently Loaded Modulefiles: 1 ) gcc/7.2.0-0 2 ) cmake/3.11.0-0 3 ) openmpi/4.0.3-0 med0127:~$ mkdir gromacs-2018.3-build-mpi med0127:~$ cd gromacs-2018.3-build-mpi med0127:~$ cmake ../gromacs-2018.3 \\ -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW = ON \\ -DGMX_MPI = ON \\ -DGMX_SIMD = AVX_256 \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = $HOME /work/software/gromacs-mpi/2018.3 \\ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = $( which mpicc ) \\ -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = $( which mpicxx ) \\ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS = off Perform the Build and Install Steps \u00b6 This is simple, using -j 32 allows us to build with 32 threads. If something goes wrong: meh, the \"joys\" of compilling C software. Getting Support for Building Software BIH HPC IT cannot provide support for compiling scientific software. Please contact the appropriate mailing lists or forums for your scientific software. You should only contact the BIH HPC IT helpdesk only if you are sure that the problem is with the BIH HPC cluster. You should try to resolve the issue on your own and with the developers of the software that you are trying to build/use. For the no-MPI version: med0127:~$ cd ../cd gromacs-2018.3-build-nompi med0127:~$ make -j 32 [ ... ] med0127:~$ make install For the MPI version: med0127:~$ cd ../cd gromacs-2018.3-build-mpi med0127:~$ make -j 32 [ ... ] med0127:~$ make install Create Environment Modules Files \u00b6 For Gromacs 2018.3, the following is appropriate. You should be able to use this as a template for your environment module files: med0127:~$ mkdir -p $HOME /local/modules/gromacs med0127:~$ cat > $HOME /local/modules/gromacs/2018.3 << \"EOF\" #%Module proc ModulesHelp { } { puts stderr { Gromacs molecular simulation toolkit ( non-MPI version ) - http://www.gromacs.org } } module-whatis { Gromacs molecular simulation toolkit ( non-MPI )} set root /fast/users/YOURUSER/work/software/gromacs-mpi/2018.3 prereq gcc/7.2.0-0 conflict gromacs conflict gromacs-mpi prepend-path LD_LIBRARY_PATH $root /lib64 prepend-path LIBRARY_PATH $root /lib64 prepend-path MANPATH $root /share/man prepend-path PATH $root /bin setenv GMXRC $root /bin/GMXRC EOF med0127:~$ mkdir -p $HOME /local/modules/gromacs-mpi med0127:~$ cat > $HOME /local/modules/gromacs-mpi/2018.3 << \"EOF\" #%Module proc ModulesHelp { } { puts stderr { Gromacs molecular simulation toolkit ( MPI version ) - http://www.gromacs.org } } module-whatis { Gromacs molecular simulation toolkit ( MPI )} set root /fast/users/YOURUSER/work/software/gromacs-mpi/2018.3 prereq openmpi/4.0.3-0 prereq gcc/7.2.0-0 conflict gromacs conflict gromacs-mpi prepend-path LD_LIBRARY_PATH $root /lib64 prepend-path LIBRARY_PATH $root /lib64 prepend-path MANPATH $root /share/man prepend-path PATH $root /bin setenv GMXRC $root /bin/GMXRC EOF With the next command, make your local modules files path known to the environemtn modules system. med0127:~$ module use $HOME /local/modules You can verify the result: med0127:~$ module avail ------------------ /fast/users/YOURUSER/local/modules ------------------ gromacs/2018.3 gromacs-mpi/2018.3 -------------------- /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles -------------------- dot module-info null module-git modules use.own -------------------------- /opt/local/modules -------------------------- cmake/3.11.0-0 llvm/6.0.0-0 openmpi/3.1.0-0 gcc/7.2.0-0 matlab/r2016b-0 openmpi/4.0.3-0 Interlude: Convenient module use \u00b6 You can add this to your ~/.bashrc file to always execute the module use after login.

You can install any software anywhere you have permission to -- somewhere in your user and group home, maybe a project home makes most sense on the BIH HPC, no root permissions required. You can also place the module files anywhere, as long as the module use line is appropriate. As a best practice, you could use the following location: User-specific installation: $HOME/work/software as a root to install software to $HOME/work/software/$PKG/$VERSION for installing a given software package in a given version $HOME/work/software/modules as the root for modules to install $HOME/work/software/$PKG/$VERSION for the module file to load the software in a given version $HOME/work/software/modules.sh as a Bash script to contain the line module use $HOME/work/software/modules Group/project specific installation for a shared setup. Don't forget to give the group and yourself read permission only so you don't accidentally damage files after instalation ( chmod ug=rX,o= $GROUP/work/software , the upper case X is essential to only set +x on directories and not files): $GROUP/work/software as a root to install software to $GROUP/work/software/$PKG/$VERSION for installing a given software package in a given version $GROUP/work/software/modules as the root for modules to install $GROUP/work/software/$PKG/$VERSION for the module file to load the software in a given version $GROUP/work/software/modules.sh as a Bash script to contain the case Bash snippet from above but with module use $GROUP/work/software/modules This setup allows multiple users to provide software installations and share it with others. Going on with Gromacs \u00b6 Every time you want to use Gromacs, you can now do med0127:~$ module load gcc/7.2.0-0 gromacs/2018.3 or, if you want to have the MPI version: med0127:~$ module load gcc/7.2.0-0 openmpi/4.0.3-0 gromacs-mpi/2018.3 Launching Gromacs \u00b6 Something along the lines of the following job script should be appropriate.

Singularity can run Docker images out-of-the-box by converting them to the singularity image format. The following guide gives a quick dive into using docker images with singularity. Build on your workstation, run on the HPC Building images using Singularity requires root privileges. We cannot give you these permissions on the BIH HPC. Thus, you will have to build the images on your local workstation (or anywhere where you have root access). You can then run the built images on the BIH HPC. This is also true for the --writeable flag. Apparently it needs root permissions which you don't have on the cluster. Quickstart \u00b6 Link ~/.singularity to ~/work/.singularity Because you only have a quota of 1 GB in your home directory, you should symlink ~/.singularity to ~/work/.singularity . host:~$ mkdir -p ~/work/.singularity && ln -sr ~/work/.singularity ~/.singularity In case you already have a singularity directory: host:~$ mv ~/.singularity ~/work/.singularity && ln -sr ~/work/.singularity ~/.singularity Run a bash in a docker image: host:~$ singularity bash docker://godlovedc/lolcow Run a command in a docker image: host:~$ singularity exec docker://godlovedc/lolcow echo \"hello, hello!\" Run a bash in a docker image, enable access to the cuda driver (--nv) and mount a path (--bind or -B): host:~$ singularity bash --nv --bind /path_on_host/:/path_inside_container/ docker://godlovedc/lolcow Some Caveats and Notes \u00b6 Caveats The default singularity images format (.sif) is read-only. By default singularity mounts /home/$USER, /tmp, and $PWD in the container. Notes Environment variables can be provided by setting them in the bash and adding the prefix SINGULARITYENV_ : host:~$ SINGULARITYENV_HELLO = 123 singularity bash docker://godlovedc/lolcow echo $HELLO Calling singularity shell or singularity exec uses as cwd the host callers cwd not the one set in the Dockerfile. One can change this by setting --pwd . Referencing/Providing Docker Images \u00b6 Option 1: Use Docker Images via Docker Hub \u00b6 The easiest variant to run a docker image available via a docker hub is by specifying its url. This causes singularity to download the image and convert it to a singularity image: host:~$ singularity run docker://godlovedc/lolcow or to open a shell inside the image host:~$ singularity bash docker://godlovedc/lolcow Furthermore, similar to docker, one can pull (and convert) remote image with the following call: host:~$ singularity pull docker://godlovedc/lolcow In case your registry requires authentication you can provide it via a prompt by adding the option --docker-login : host:~$ singularity pull --docker-login docker://ilumb/mylolcow or by setting the following environment variables: host:~$ export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_USERNAME = ilumb host:~$ export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_PASSWORD = <redacted> host:~$ singularity pull docker://ilumb/mylolcow More details can be found in the Singularity documentation . Option 2: Converting Docker Images \u00b6 Another option is to convert your docker image into the Singularity image format. This can be easily done using the docker images provided by docker2singularity . To convert the docker image docker_image_name to the singularity image singularity_image_name one can use the following command line. The output image will be located in output_directory_for_images . host:~$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --privileged -t --rm quay.io/singularity/docker2singularity -v /output_directory_for_images/:/output --name singularity_image_name docker_image_name The resulting image can then directly be used as image: host:~$ singularity bash singularity_image_name Conversion Compatibility \u00b6 Here are some tips for making Docker images compatible with Singularity taken from docker2singulrity : Define all environmental variables using the ENV instruction set. Do not rely on ~/.bashrc , ~/.profile , etc. Define an ENTRYPOINT instruction set pointing to the command line interface to your pipeline. Do not define CMD - rely only on ENTRYPOINT . You can interactively test the software inside the container by overriding the ENTRYPOINT docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash bids/example . Do not rely on being able to write anywhere other than the home folder and /scratch. Make sure your container runs with the --read-only --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /tmp parameters (this emulates the read-only behavior of Singularity). Don't rely on having elevated user permissions.

It is a software that allows to establish a user-connection to a remote UNIX/Linux machine over the network and remote-control it from your local work-station. Let's say you have an HPC cluster with hundreds of machines somewhere in a remote data-center and you want to connect to those machines to issue commands and run jobs. Then you would use SSH. Getting Started \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 Simply install your distributions openssh-client package. You should be able to find plenty of good tutorials online. On Windows you can consider using MobaXterm (recommended) or Putty . Connecting \u00b6 Let's call your local machine the client and the remote machine you want to connect to the server. You will usually have some kind of connection information, like a hostname, IP address and perhaps a port number. Additionally, you should also have received your user-account information stating your user-name, your password, etc. Follow the instructions below to establish a remote terminal-session. If your are on Linux Open a terminal and issue the following command while replacing all the <...> fields with the actual data: # default port ssh <username>@<hostname-or-ip-address> # non-default port ssh <username>@<hostname-or-ip-address> -p <port-number> If you are on windows Start putty.exe , go into the Session category and fill out the form, then click the Connect button. Putty also allows to save the connection information in different profiles so you don't have to memorize and retype all fields every time you want to connect. SSH-Keys \u00b6 When you connect to a remote machine via SSH, you will be prompted for your password. This will happen every single time you connect and can feel a bit repetitive at times, especially if you feel that your password is hard to memorize. For those who don't want to type in their password every single time they connect, an alternative way of authentication is available. Meet SSH-Keys. It is possible to create an SSH-Key that can be used as a replacement for the password. Instead if being prompted for a password, SSH will simply use the key to authenticate. You can generate a new key by issuing: client:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 # 1. Choose file in which to save the key *(leave blank for default)* # 2. Choose a passphrase of at least five characters How do SSH-Keys work? \u00b6 An SSH-Key consists of two files, a private-key-file and a public-key-file. The public key can then be installed on an arbitrary amount of remote machines. If a server with the public key receives a connection from a client with the correct private key, access is granted without having to type a password. Passphrase \u00b6 The security problem with SSH keys is that anyone with access to the private key has full access to all machines that have the public key installed. Loosing the key or getting it compromised in another way imposes a serious security threat. Therefore, it is best to secure the private key with a passphrase. This passphrase is needed to unlock and use the private key. Once you have your key-pair generated, you can easily change the passphrase of that key by issuing: client:~$ ssh-keygen -p SSH-Agent \u00b6 In order to avoid having to type the passphrase of the key every time we want to use it, the key can be loaded into an SSH-Agent. For instance, if you have connected to a login-node via Putty and want to unlock your private key in order to be able to access cluster nodes, you cant configure the SSH-Agent. client:~$ source < ( ssh-agent ) (The above command will load the required environment variables of the SSH-Agent into your shell environment, effectively making the agent available for your consumption.) Next, you can load your private key: client:~$ ssh-add (You will be prompted for the passphrase of the key) You can verify that the agent is running and your key is loaded by issuing: client:~$ ssh-add -l # 'l' as in list-all-loaded-keys (The command should print at least one key, showing the key-size, the hash of the key-fingerprint and the location of the file in the file-system.) Since all home-directories are shared across the entire cluster and you created your key-pair inside your home-directory, you public-key (which is also in your home-directory) is automatically installed on all other cluster nodes, immediately. Try connecting to any cluster node. It should not prompt your for a password. There is nothing you have to do to \"unload\" or \"lock\" the key-file.

Depending on the app they run as servers or GUIs. Selecting My Interactive Sessions in the top menu will direct you to the overview of currently running sessions. The left-hand panel provides a short cut to start a new session of one of the provided apps. Each running interactive session is listed. Each card corresponds to one session. The title of each card provides the name, allocated resources and the current status. Furthermore, detailed information and links are available: Host : Provides the name of the node the session is running on. Click on the host name to open a shell to the given cluster node.

Connect to : This will open the app in your browser (opens a new tab). Delete : Terminate the session. Don't hit reload in your apps Please note that the portal will use the authentication mechanisms of the apps to ensure that nobody except for you can connect to the session. This means that hitting the browsers \"reload\" button in your app will most likely not work. Just go back to the interactive session list and click on the \"connect\" button. Session Directories \u00b6 The portal software will create a folder ondemand in your home directory. Inside, it will create session directories for each started interactive job. For technical reasons, these folders have very long names, for example: $HOME/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood-bih-rstudio-server/output/e40e03b3-11ca-458a-855b-98e6f148c99a/ This follows the pattern: $HOME/${application name}/output/${job UUID} The job identifier used is not the Slurm job ID but an identifier internal to OnDemand. Inside this directory you will find log files and a number of scripts that are used to start your job. If you need to debug any interactive job, start here. Also, the helpdesk will need the path to this folder to help you with interactive jobs. You can find the name of the latest output folder with the following command: $ ls -lhtr $HOME / ${ application name } /output | tail -n 1 For example, for RStudio Server: $ ls -lhtr $HOME /ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood-bih-rstudio-server/output | tail -n 1 Prevent Home From Filling Up You should probably move ~/ondemand to your work volume with the following: $ mv ~/ondemand ~/work/ondemand $ ln -sr ~/work/ondemand ~/ondemand Also, clear out ~/work/ondemand/* from time to time but take care that you don't remove the directory of any running job.

To start the session, please go to Interactive Apps in the top menu bar and select RStudio Server or click RStudio Server in the left-hand panel. Allocate appropriate resources and click Launch . An info card for the RStudio Server will be added to My Interactive Sessions , and during start, it will change its state from Queued to Starting to Running .

Inside this directory you will find log files and a number of scripts that are used to start your job. If you need to debug any interactive job, start here. Also, the helpdesk will need the path to this folder to help you with interactive jobs. You can find the name of the latest output folder with the following command: $ ls -lhtr $HOME / ${ application name } /output | tail -n 1 For example, for RStudio Server: $ ls -lhtr $HOME /ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood-bih-rstudio-server/output | tail -n 1 Prevent Home From Filling Up You should probably move ~/ondemand to your work volume with the following: $ mv ~/ondemand ~/work/ondemand $ ln -sr ~/work/ondemand ~/ondemand Also, clear out ~/work/ondemand/* from time to time but take care that you don't remove the directory of any running job.","title":"Session Directories"},{"location":"ondemand/interactive/#example-rstudio-session","text":"This description of starting an RStudio session is a showcase for starting other interactive apps as well.

HPC 4 Research vs. HPC 4 Clinic \u00b6 BIH HPC IT operates two clusters: HPC 4 Research and HPC 4 Clinic. HPC 4 Research is the older and larger of both. It is located in the BIH data center in Buch and connected via the BIH research networks. Connections can be made from Charite, MDC, and BIH networks. The cluster is open for users with either Charite or MDC accounts after getting access through the gatekeeper proces . The system has been designed to be suitable for the processing of human genetics data from research contexts (and of course data without data privacy concerns such as public and mouse data). HPC 4 Clinic (BETA) is the more recent and smaller cluster. It is located in the Charite data center on the Charite Campus Virchowklinikum and connected only to the Charite network (\"Kernnetz\"). Connections can only be made from Charite networks. The cluster is open for users with a Charite account after getting access through the gatekeeper proces . The system has also been designed to be suitable for the processing of human genetics data but is located within the hospital physical walls and network firewalls. It is thus also suitable for the processing of data from clinical context. Administration provides a system with state of the art IT security, users are responsible to obtain proper data privacy and ethics votes. !!! important \"HPC 4 Clinic is in Beta Status Do not use for production purposes or with critical data during beta test! We will notify you when the HPC 4 Clinic cluster becomes stable. Cluster Hardware and Scheduling \u00b6 HPC 4 Research The cluster consists of the following major components: 2 login nodes for users transfer-1 and transfer-2 (for interactive sessions only), 2 nodes for file transfers transfer-1 and transfer-2 , a scheduling system using Slurm, approximately 200 general purpose compute nodes med01XX , med02XX , med05XX , med06XX , med07XX . a few high memory nodes med040[1-4] , 4 nodes with 4 Tesla GPUs each (!) med030[1-4] , a high-performance, parallel GPFS file system with 2.1 PB, by DDN mounted at /fast , a slower \"classic\" ZFS file system available through NFS with ~250 TB mounted at /slow . This is shown by the following picture: HPC 4 Clinic The cluster consists of the following major components: 2 login nodes for users login-1.clinic.hpc.bihealth.org (and login-2 ). a scheduling system using Slurm, 24 general purpose compute nodes cc-node0[00-23] 3 nodes with 4 Tesla GPUs each (!) cc-node02[4-6] an Isilon scale-out NAS system mounted at /data/isilon-1 with ~1.2PB of space (~100TB on SSDs). Differences Between Workstations and Clusters \u00b6 The differences include: The directly reachable login nodes are not meant for computation! Use srun to go to a compute node. Every time you type srun to go to a compute node you might end up on a different host. Most directories on the nodes are not shared, including /tmp . The /fast directory is shared throughout the cluster which contains your home, group home, and project directories. You will not get root or sudo permissions on the cluster. You should prefer batch jobs ( sbatch ) over calling programs interactively. What the Cluster Is and Is NOT \u00b6 NB: the following might sound a bit harsh but is written with everyone's best intentions in mind (we actually like you, our user!) This addresses a lot of suboptimal (yet not dangerous, of course) points we observed in our users. IT IS It is scientific infrastructure just like a lab workbench or miscroscope. It is there to be used for you and your science. We trust you to behave in a collaboratively. We will monitor usage, though, and call out offenders. With its ~200 nodes, ~6400 threads and fast parallel I/O, it is a powerful resource for life science high performance computation, originally optimized at bioinformatics sequence processing. A place for data move data at the beginning of your project. By definition, every project has an end. Your project data needs to leave the cluster at the end of the project. A collaborative resource with central administration managed by BIH HPC IT and supported via hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de IT IS NOT A self-administrated workstation or servers. You will not get sudo . We will not install software beyond those in broad use and available in CentOS Core or EPEL repositories. You can install software in your user/group/project directories, for example using Conda. A place to store primary copies of your data. You only get 1 GB of storage in your home for scripts, configuration, and documents. A safe place to store data. Only your 1 GB of home is in snapshots and backup. While data is stored on redundant disks, technical or administrative failure might eventually lead to data loss. We do everything humanly possible to prevent this. Despite this, it is your responsibility to keep important files in the snapshot/backup protected home, ideally even in copy (e.g., a git repository) elsewhere. Also, keeping safe copies of primary data files, your published results, and the steps in between reproducible is your responsibility. A place to store data indefinitely. The fast GPFS storage is expensive and \"sparse\" in a way. The general workflow is: (1) copy data to cluster, (2) process it, creating intermediate and final results, (3) copy data elsewhere and remove it from the cluster Generally suitable for primary software development. The I/O system might get overloaded and saving scripts might take some time. We know of people who do this and it works for them. Your mileage might vary. Locations on the Cluster \u00b6 Your home directory is located in /fast/users/$USER . Your home is for scripts, source code, and configuration only. Use your work directory for large files. The quota in the home directory is 1 GB but we have nightly snapshots and backups thereof. Your work directory is located in /fast/users/$USER/work . This is where you should place large files. Files in this location do not have snapshots or backups. The directory (actually a GPFS file set) /fast/users/$USER/scratch should be used for temporary data. All data placed there will be removed after 4 weeks. If you are part of an AG/lab working on the cluster, the group directory is in /fast/groups/$AG . Projects are located in /fast/projects/$PROJECT . So-called dot files/directories filling up your home? Files and directories starting with a dot \" . \" are not shown with the \"ls\" command. May users run into problems with directories such as $HOME/.local but also non-dot directories such as $HOME/R filling up their storage. You should move such large directories to your work volume and only keep a symlink in your $HOME . Here is how you find large directories: host:~$ du -shc ~/.* ~/* --exclude = .. --exclude = . Here is how you move them to your work and replace them with a symlink, e.g., for ~/.local : host:~$ mv ~/.local ~/work/.local host:~$ ln -s ~/work/.local ~/.local Also see the related FAQ entry . Temporary Directories \u00b6 Note that you also have access to /tmp on the individual nodes but the disk is small and might be a slow spinning disk. If you are processing large NGS data, we recommend you create /fast/users/$USER/scratch/tmp and set the environment variable TMPDIR to point there. However, for creating locks special Unix files such as sockets or fifos, /tmp is the right place. Note that files placed in your scratch directory will be removed automatically after 4 weeks. Do not place any valueable files in there. First Steps on the Cluster \u00b6 Connecting to the Cluster \u00b6 HPC 4 Research From the Charite, MDC, and BIH networks, you can connect to the cluster login nodes login-{1,2}.research.hpc.bihealth.org . For Charite users, your name is ${USER}_c , for MDC users, your account is ${USER}_m where $USER is the login name of your primary location. From the outside, for MDC users , the cluster is accessible via ssh1.mdc-berlin.de (you need to enable SSH key agent forwarding for this) Note that you have to use your MDC user name (without any suffix _m ) for connecting to this host. Also note that BIH HPC IT does not have control over ssh1.mdc-berlin.de . You have to contact MDC IT in case of any issues. From the outside, for Charite users, there is no SSH hop node. Instead, you have to apply for VPN through Charite Gesch\u00e4ftsbereich IT. You can use this form availble in Charite Intranet for this. Please refer to the Charite intranet or helpdesk@charite.de for more information. Also consider using the OnDemand Portal at https://portal.research.hpc.bihealth.org . HPC 4 Clinic You have to login from the Charite network with your charite account to login-{1,2}.clinic.hpc.bihealth.org . Access from VPN is currently not possible. Also consider using the OnDemand Portal at https://portal.clinic.hpc.bihealth.org . Connecting to Compute Node through Login Node \u00b6 After logging into the cluster, you are on the login node <cluster>-login<X> ( <cluster> is either res for HPC 4 Research and cln for HPC 4 Clinic; <X> can be either 1 or 2 ). When transferring files, use the transfer-1 or transfer-2 nodes (HPC 4 Research only). You should not do computation or other work on the login or file transfer nodes, but use the compute nodes instead.

Multiple users can use the system simultaneously to do their work. This means that the system needs to join multiple computers ( nodes ) to provide a coherent view of them and the same time partition the system to allow multiple users to work concurrently. user 1 user 2 ... .---. .---. .---. .---. | J | | J | | J | | J | | o | | o | | o | | o | ... | b | | b | | b | | b | | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | | 4 | '---' '---' '---' '---' .------------------------------------------. | Cluster Scheduler | '------------------------------------------' .----------. .------------. .------------. | multiple | | separate | | computers | '----------' '------------' '------------' Interlude: Partitioning Single Computers \u00b6 Overall, this partitioning is not so different from how your workstation or laptop works. Most likely, your computer (or even your smartphone) has multiple processors (or cores). You can run multiple programs on the same computer and the fact that (a) there is more than one core and (b) there is more than one program running is not known to the running programs (unless they explicitly communicate with each other). Different programs can explicitly take advantage of the multiple processor cores. The main difference is that you normally use your computer in an interactive fashion (you perform an action and expect an immediate reaction). Even with a single processor (and core), your computer manages to run more than one program at the same time. This is done with the so-called time-slicing approach where the operating system lets each programs run in turn for a short time (a few milliseconds). A program with a higher priority will get more time slices than one with a lower (e.g., your audio player has real-time requirements and you will hear artifacts if it is starved for compute resources). Your operating system protects programs from each other by creating an address space for each. When two programs are running, the value of the memory at any given position in one program is independent from the value in the other program. Your operating system offers explicit functionality for sharing certain memory areas that two programs can use to exchange data efficiently. Similarly, file permissions with Unix users/groups or Unix/Windows ACLs (access control lists) are used to isolate users from each other. Programs can share data by accessing the same file if they can both access it. There are special files called sockets that allow for network-like inter-process communication but of course two programs on the same computer can also connect (virtually) via the computer network (no data will actually go through a cable). Interlude: Resource Types \u00b6 As another diversion, let us consider how Unix manages its resources. This is important to understand when requesting resources from the scheduler later on. First of all, a computer might offer a certain feature such as a specific hardware platform or special network connection. Examples for this on the BIH HPC are specific Intel processor generations such as haswell or the availability of Infiniband networking. You can request these with so-called constraints; they are not allocated to specific jobs. Second, there are resources that are allocated to specific jobs. The most important resources here are: computing resources (processors/CPUs (central progressing units) and cores, details are explained below), main memory / RAM, special hardware such as GPUs, and (wall-clock) time that a job wants to run as an upper bound. Generally, once a resource has been allocated to one job, it is not available to another. This means if you allocating more resources to your job that you actually need ( overallocation ) then those resources are not available to other jobs (whether they are your jobs or those of other users). This will be explained further below. Another example of resource allocation are licenses . The BIH HPC has a few Matlab 2016b licenses that users can request. As long as a license is allocated to one job, it is unavailable to another. Nodes, Sockets, Processors, Cores, Threads \u00b6 Regarding compute resources, Slurm differentiates between: nodes: a compute server, sockets: a socket in the compute server that hosts one physical processor, processor: a CPU or a CPU core in a multi-core computer (all CPUs in the BIH HPC are multi-core), and (hardware) threads: most Intel CPUs feature hardware threads (also known as \"hyperthreading\") where each core appears to be two cores. In most cases, you will use one compute node only. When using more than one node, you will need to use some form of message passing, e.g., MPI, so processes on different nodes can communicate. On a single node you would mostly use single- or multi-threaded processes, or multiple processes. Above: Slurm's nomenclature for sockets, processors, cores, and threads (from Slurm Documentation ). Co-locating processes/threads on the same socket has certain implications that are mostly useful for numerical applications. We will not further go into detail here. Slurm provides many different features of ways to specify allocation of \"pinning\" to specific process locations. If you need this feature, we trust that you find sufficient explanation in the Slurm documentation. Usually, you would allocate multiple cores (a term Slurm uses synonymously with processors) on a single node (allocation on a single node is the default). How Scheduling Works \u00b6 Slurm is an acronym for \"Simple Linux Unix Resource Manager\" (note that the word \"scheduler\" does not occur here). Actually, one classically differentiates between the managing of resources and the scheduling of jobs that use them. The resource manager allocates resources according to a user's request for a job and ensures that there are no conflicts. If the required resources are not available, the scheduler puts the user's job into a queue. Later, when then requested resources become available the scheduler assigns them to the job and runs it. In the following, both resource allocation and the running of the job are described as being done by the scheduler . The interesting case occurs when there are not enough resources available for at least two jobs submitted to the scheduler. The scheduler has to decide how to proceed. Consider the simplified case of only scheduling cores. Each job will request a number of cores. The scheduler will then generate a scheduling plan that might look as follows. core ^ 4 | |---job2---| 3 | |---job2---| 2 | |---job2---| 1 | |--job1--| +--------------------------> t time 5 1 1 2 0 5 0 job1 has been allocated one core and job2 has been allocated two cores. When job3 , requesting one core is submitted at t = 5 , it has to wait at least as long until job1 is finished. If job3 requested two or more cores, it would have to wait at least until job2 also finished. We can now ask several questions, including the following: What if a job runs for less than the allocated time? -- In this case, resources become free and the scheduler will attempt to select the next job(s) to run. What if a job runs longer than the allocated time? -- In this case, the scheduler will send an informative Unix signal to the process first. The job will be given a bit more time and if it does not exit it will be forcibly terminated. You will find a note about this at the end of your job log file. What if multiple jobs compete for resources? -- The scheduler will prefer certain jobs over others using the Slurm Multifactor Priority Plugin . In practice, small jobs will be preferred over large, users with few used resources in the last month will be favored over heavy consumers, long-waiting jobs will be favored over recently submitted jobs, and many other factors. You can use the sprio utility to inspect these factors in real-time. How does the scheduler handle new requests? -- Generally, the scheduler will add new jobs to the waiting queue. The scheduler regularly adjusts its planning by recalculating job priorities. Slurm is configured to perform computationally simple schedule recalculations quite often and larger recalculations more infrequently. Also see the Slurm Frequently Asked Questions . Please note that even if all jobs were known at the start of time, scheduling is still a so-called NP-complete problem. Entire computer science journals and books are dedicated only to scheduling. Things get more complex in the case of online scheduling, in which new jobs can appear at any time. In practice, Slurm does a fantastic job with its heuristics but it heavily relies on parameter tuning. HPC administration is constantly working on optimizing the scheduler settings. Note that you can use the --format option to the squeue command to request that it shows you information about job scheduling (in particular, see the %S field, which will show you the expected start time for a job, assuming Slurm has calculated it). See man squeue for details. If you observe inexplicable behavior, please notify us at hpc-helpdesk@bihealth.de . Slurm Partitions \u00b6 In Slurm, the nodes of a cluster are split into partitions . Nodes are assigned to one or more partition (see the Job Scheduler section for details). Jobs can also be assigned to one or more partitions and are executed on nodes of the given partition. In the BIH HPC, partitions are used to stratify jobs of certain running times and to provide different quality of service (e.g., maximal number of CPU cores available to a user for jobs of a certain running time and size). The partitions gpu and highmem provide special hardware (the nodes are not assigned to other partitions) and the mpi partition allows MPI-parallelism and the allocation of jobs to more than one node. The Job Scheduler provides further details.","title":"Introduction to Scheduling"},{"location":"slurm/background/#introduction-to-scheduling","text":"As explained elsewhere in more detail, an HPC cluster consists of multiple computers connected via a network and working together.

Most likely, your computer (or even your smartphone) has multiple processors (or cores). You can run multiple programs on the same computer and the fact that (a) there is more than one core and (b) there is more than one program running is not known to the running programs (unless they explicitly communicate with each other). Different programs can explicitly take advantage of the multiple processor cores. The main difference is that you normally use your computer in an interactive fashion (you perform an action and expect an immediate reaction). Even with a single processor (and core), your computer manages to run more than one program at the same time. This is done with the so-called time-slicing approach where the operating system lets each programs run in turn for a short time (a few milliseconds). A program with a higher priority will get more time slices than one with a lower (e.g., your audio player has real-time requirements and you will hear artifacts if it is starved for compute resources). Your operating system protects programs from each other by creating an address space for each. When two programs are running, the value of the memory at any given position in one program is independent from the value in the other program. Your operating system offers explicit functionality for sharing certain memory areas that two programs can use to exchange data efficiently. Similarly, file permissions with Unix users/groups or Unix/Windows ACLs (access control lists) are used to isolate users from each other. Programs can share data by accessing the same file if they can both access it.

Representative Example # Execute job.sh in partition medium with 4 threads and 4GB of RAM total for a # running time of up to one day. med-login:~$ sbatch --partition = medium --mem = 4G --ntasks 4 --time = 1 -00 job.sh Submitted batch job JOB_ID The command will create a batch job and add it to the queue to be executed at a later point in time. Slurm Documentation: sbatch Please also see the official Slurm documentation on srun . Important Arguments \u00b6 --nodes -- The number of nodes to allocate. This is only given here as an important argument as the maximum number of nodes allocatable to any partition but mpi is set to one (1). This is done as there are few users on the BIH HPC that actually use multi-node paralleilsm. Rather, most users will use multi-core parallelism and might forget to limit the number of nodes which causes inefficient allocation of resources. --ntasks -- This corresponds to the number of threads allocated to each node. --mem -- The memory to allocate for the job. As you can define minimal and maximal number of tasks/CPUs/cores, you could also specify --mem-per-cpu and get more flexible scheduling of your job. --gres -- Generic resource allocation. On the BIH HPC, this is only used for allocating GPUS, e.g., with --gres=gpu:tesla:2 , a user could allocate two NVIDIA Tesla GPUs on the same hsot. --licenses -- On the BIH HPC, this is used for the allocation of MATLAB 2016b licenses only. --partition -- The partition to run in. Also see the Job Scheduler section. --time -- Specify the running time, see man sbatch or the official Slurm documentation on srun for supported formats. **Please note that the DRMA API only accepts the hours:minutes format. --dependency -- Specify dependencies on other jobs, e.g., using --dependency afterok:JOBID to only execute if the job with ID JOBID finished successfully or --dependency after:JOBID to wait for a job to finish regardless of its termination status. --constraint -- Require one or more features from your node. On the BIH HPC, the processor generation is defined as a feature on the nodes, e.g., haswell , or special networking such as infiniband . You can have a look at /etc/slurm/slurm.conf on all configured features. --output -- The path to the output log file (by default joining stdout and stderr, see the man page on --error on how to redirect stderr separately). A various number of placeholders is available, see the \"filename pattern\" section of man sbatch or the official Slurm documentation on srun . --mail-type=<type> -- Send out notifications by email when an event occurs. Use FAIL to get emails when your job fails. Also see the documentation of sbatch in the Slurm manual . --mail-user=<email> -- The email address to send to. Must end in @charite.de , @mdc-berlin.de , or @bihealth.de . Ensure your --output directory exists! In the case that the path to the log/output file does not exist, the job will just fail. scontrol show job ID will report JobState=FAILED Reason=NonZeroExitCode . Regrettably, no further information is displayed to you as the user. Always check that the path to the directories in StdErr and StdOut exists when checking scontrol show job ID . Other Arguments \u00b6 --job-name Job Scripts \u00b6 Also see the section Slurm Job Scripts on how to embed the sbatch parameters in #SBATCH lines. Notes \u00b6 This is the primary entry point for creating batch jobs to be executed at a later point in time. As with all jobs allocated by Slurm, interactive sessions executed with sbatch are governed by resource allocations, in particular: sbatch jobs have a maximal running time set, sbatch jobs have a maximal memory and number of cores set, and also see scontrol show job JOBID .","title":"sbatch"},{"location":"slurm/commands-sbatch/#slurm-command-sbatch","text":"The sbatch command allows you to put a job into the scheduler's queue to be executed at a later time.

Also see the Job Scheduler section. --time -- Specify the running time, see man sbatch or the official Slurm documentation on srun for supported formats. **Please note that the DRMA API only accepts the hours:minutes format. --dependency -- Specify dependencies on other jobs, e.g., using --dependency afterok:JOBID to only execute if the job with ID JOBID finished successfully or --dependency after:JOBID to wait for a job to finish regardless of its termination status. --constraint -- Require one or more features from your node. On the BIH HPC, the processor generation is defined as a feature on the nodes, e.g., haswell , or special networking such as infiniband . You can have a look at /etc/slurm/slurm.conf on all configured features. --output -- The path to the output log file (by default joining stdout and stderr, see the man page on --error on how to redirect stderr separately). A various number of placeholders is available, see the \"filename pattern\" section of man sbatch or the official Slurm documentation on srun . --mail-type=<type> -- Send out notifications by email when an event occurs. Use FAIL to get emails when your job fails. Also see the documentation of sbatch in the Slurm manual . --mail-user=<email> -- The email address to send to. Must end in @charite.de , @mdc-berlin.de , or @bihealth.de . Ensure your --output directory exists! In the case that the path to the log/output file does not exist, the job will just fail. scontrol show job ID will report JobState=FAILED Reason=NonZeroExitCode . Regrettably, no further information is displayed to you as the user.

In contrast, scontrol show job <id> and scontrol show partition <id> and scontrol show node <id> show comprehensive information that quickly gets hard to comprehend for multiple entries. Now you might ask: is there anything in between? And: yes, there is . You can tune the output of sinfo and squeue using parameters, in particular by providing format strings . All of this is described in the man pages of the commands that you can display with man sinfo and man squeue on the cluster. Tuning sinfo Output \u00b6 Notable arguments of sinfo are: -N, --Node -- uncompress the usual lines and display one line per node and partition. -s, --summarize -- compress the node state, more compact display. -R, --list-reasons -- for nodes that are not up , display reason string provided by admin. -o <fmt>, --format=<fmt> -- use format string for display. The most interesting argument is -o/--format . The man page lists the following values that are used when using other arguments. In other words, many of the display modifications could also be applied with -o/--format . default \"%#P %.5a %.10l %.6D %.6t %N\" --summarize \"%#P %.5a %.10l %.16F %N\" --long \"%#P %.5a %.10l %.10s %.4r %.8h %.10g %.6D %.11T %N\" --Node \"%#N %.6D %#P %6t\" --long --Node \"%#N %.6D %#P %.11T %.4c %.8z %.6m %.8d %.6w %.8f %20E\" --list-reasons \"%20E %9u %19H %N\" --long --list-reasons \"%20E %12U %19H %6t %N\" The best way to learn more about this is to play around with sinfo -o , starting out with one of the format strings above. Details about the format strings are described in man sinfo .

This section first gives some technical background and then explains how to implement this properly with Slurm on the BIH HPC. Technical Background \u00b6 Technical Background Summary virtual memory is what your programs tells the operating system it wants to use resident set size is the amount of memory that your program actually uses most memory will be allocated on the heap Main memory used to be one of the most important topics when programming, as computers had so little. There is the infamous quote \"640KB ought ot be enough for anybody\" wrongly attribute to Bill Gates which refers to the fact that early computers could only address that amount of memory. In MS DOS, one had to use special libraries for a program to use more memory. Today, computers are very fast and memory is plentiful and people can (rightfully) forget about memory allocation ... as long as they don't use \"much\" memory by today's standards. The Linux operating system differentiates between the following types of memory: virtual memory size (vsize) , the amount of memory that a process (virtually) allocates, resident set size (rss) , the amount of memory actually used and currently in the computer's main memory, the swap memory usage , the amount of active memory that is not present in main memory but on the computer's disk, sometimes, the shared memory is also interesting, and it might be interesting to know about heap and stack size. Note that above we are talking about processes, not Slurm jobs yet. Let us look at this in detail: Each program uses some kind of memory management. For example, in C the malloc and free functions manually allocate and free memory while in Java, R, and Python, memory allocation and release is done automatically using a concept called garbage collection. Each program starts with a certain virtual memory size , that is the amount of memory it can address, say 128MB. When the program allocates memory, the memory allocation mechanism will check whether it has sufficient space left. If not, it will request an increase in virtual memory from the operating system, e.g., to 256MB. If this fails then the program can try to handle the error, e.g., terminate gracefully, but many programs will just panic and stop. Otherwise, the program will get access to more memory and happily continue to run. However, programs can allocate humonguous amounts of virtual memory and only use a little. Memory is organized in \"pages\" (classically these are 4096 bytes each, but can be larger using so-called \"huge page\" features). The operating system tracks which memory pages are actually used by a process. The total size of these pages is called the resident set size : the amount of memory that is actually currently used by a program. Programs can also mark pages as unused again, thus freeing resident memory and can also decrease their virtual memory. In some cases it is still interesting to use swap memory . Here, the contents of resident memory are copied to disk by the operating system. This process is completely transparent to the program; the data remains available at the original positions in the virtual memory ! However, accessing it will take some time as it must be read back into main memory from the disk. In this way, it was possible for a computer with 4MB of RAM and a disk of 100MB to run programs that used 8MB. Of course, this was only really useable for programs that ran in the background. One could really feel the latency if a graphical program was using swapped memory (you could actually hear the hard drive working). Today, swap storage is normally only relevant when put your computer into hibernation. Given the large main memory on the cluster nodes, their small local hard drives (just used for loading the operating system), and the extreme slowness involved in using swapped memory, the BIH HPC nodes have no swap memory allocated. Most HPC users will also use shared memory , at least implicitly. Whenever a program uses fork to create a subprocess (BTW, this is not a thread), the program can chose to \"copy\" its current address space. The second process then has access to the same memory than the parent process in a copy-on-write fashion. This allows, for example, pre-loading a database, and also allows the use of already loaded library code by the child process as well. If the child process writes to the copy-on-write memory of the parent, the relevant memory page will be copied and attributed to the child. Two or more processes can share the same memory explicitly. This is usually used for inter-process communication but the Bowtie program uses it for sharing the memory of indices. For example, the Python multiprocessing module will use this, including if you have two MPI processes running on the same host. Memory is also separated into segments, the most interesting ones are heap and stack memory. For compiled languages, memory can be allocated on either. For C, an int variable will be allocated on the stack. Every time you call a function, a stack frame is created in memory to hold the local variables and other information for the duration of the function execution. The stack thus grows through function calls made by your program and shrinks when the functions return. The stack size for a process is limited (by ulimit -s ) and a program that goes too deep (e.g., via infinite recursion) will be terminated by the operating system if it exceeds this limit. Again in C, int * ptr = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); will allocate memory for one variable (an integer pointer) on the stack and memory for 10 integers on the heap. When the function returns, the ptr variable on the stack will be freed but to free the array of integers, you'd have to call free(ptr) . If the memory is not freed then this constitutes a memory leak , but that is another topic. Other relevant segments are code , where the compiled code lives, and data , where static data such as strings displayed to the user are stored. As a side node, in interpreted languages such as R or Python, the code and data segments will refer to the code and data of Python while the actual program text will be on the heap. Interlude: Memory in Java \u00b6 Memory in Java Summary set -XX:MaxHeapSize=<size> (e.g., <size>=2G ) for your program and only tune the other parameters if needed also consider the amount of memory that Java needs for heap management in your Slurm allocations Java's memory management provides for some interesting artifacts. When running simple Java programs, you will never run into this but if you need to use gigabytes of memory in Java then you will have to learn a bit about Java memory management. This is the case when running GATK programs, for example. As different operating systems handle memory management differently, the Java virtual machine does its own memory management to provide a consistent interface. The following three settings are important in governing memory usage of Java: -Xmx<size> / -XX:MaxHeapSize=<size> -- the maximal Java heap size -Xms<size> / -XX:InitialHeapSize=<size> -- the initial Java heap size -Xss<size> / -XX:ThreadStackSize=<size> -- maximal stack size available to a Java thread (e.g., the main thread) Above, <size> is a memory specification, either in bytes or with a suffix, e.g., 80M , or 1G . On startup, Java does roughly the following: Setup the core virtual machine, load libraries, etc. and allocate (vsize) consume (rss) memory on the OS (operating system) heap . Setup the Java heap allocate (vsize) and consume (rss) memory on the OS heap . In particular, Java will need to setup data structures for the memory management of each individual object. Run the program where Java data and Java threads will lead to memory allocation (vsize) and consumption (rss) of memory. Memory freed by the Java garbage collector can be re-used by other Java objects (rss remains the same) or be freed in the operating system (rss decreases). The Java VM program itself will also consume memory on the OS stack but that is negligible. Overall, the Java VM needs to store in main memory: The Java VM, program code, Java thread stacks etc. (very little memory). The Java heap (potentially a lot of memory). The Java heap management data structures (so-called \"off-heap\", but of course on the OS heap ) (potentially also considerable memory). In the BIH HPC context, the following is recommended to: Set the Java heap to an appropriate size (use trial-and-error to determine the correct size or look through internet forums). Only tune initial heap size in the case of performance issues (unlikely in batch processing). Only bump the stack size when problems occur. Consider \"off-heap\" memory when performing Slurm allocations. Memory Allocation in Slurm \u00b6 Memory Allocation in Slurm Summary most user will simply use --memory=<size> (e.g., <size>=3G ) to allocate memory per node both interactive srun and batch sbatch jobs are governed by Slurm memory allocation the sum of all memory of all processes started by your job may not exceed the job reservation. please don't over-allocate memory, see \"Memory Accounting in Slurm\" below for details Our Slurm configuration uses Linux cgroups to enforce a maximum amount of resident memory. You simply specify it using --memory=<size> in your srun and sbatch command. In the (rare) case that you provide more flexible number of threads (Slurm tasks) or GPUs, you could also look into --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu . The official Slurm sbatch manual is quite helpful, as is man sbatch on the cluster command line. Slurm (or rather Linux via cgroups) will track all memory started by all jobs by your process. If each process works independently (e.g., you put the output through a pipe prog1 | prog2 ) then the amount of memory consumed will at any given time be the sum of the RSS of both processes at that time . If your program uses fork , which uses memory in a copy-on-write fashion, the shared memory is of course only counted once. Note that Python's multiprocessing does not use copy on write: its data will be explicitly copied and consume additional memory. Refer to the Scipy/Numpy/Pandas etc. documentation on how to achieve parallelism without copying too much data. The amount of virtual memory that your program can reserve is only \"virtually\" unlimited (pun not intended). However, in practice, the operating system will not like you allocating more than physically available. If your program attempts to allocate more memory than requested via Slurm, your program will be killed. This is reported to you in the Slurm job output log as something like: slurmstepd: error: Detected 1 oom-kill event(s) in step <JOB ID>.batch cgroup. Some of your processes may have been killed by the cgroup out-of-memory handler. You can inspect the amount of memory available on each node in total with sinfo --format \"%.10P %.10l %.6D %.6m %N\" , as shown below. $ sinfo --format \"%.10P %.10l %.6D %.6m %N\" PARTITION TIMELIMIT NODES MEMORY NODELIST debug* 8 :00:00 240 128722 med [ 0101 -0164,0201-0264,0501-0516,0601-0632,0701-0764 ] medium 7 -00:00:00 240 128722 med [ 0101 -0164,0201-0264,0501-0516,0601-0632,0701-0764 ] long 28 -00:00:0 240 128722 med [ 0101 -0164,0201-0264,0501-0516,0601-0632,0701-0764 ] critical 7 -00:00:00 176 128722 med [ 0101 -0164,0501-0516,0601-0632,0701-0764 ] highmem 14 -00:00:0 4 515762 med [ 0401 -0404 ] gpu 14 -00:00:0 4 385215 med [ 0301 -0304 ] mpi 14 -00:00:0 240 128722 med [ 0101 -0164,0201-0264,0501-0516,0601-0632,0701-0764 ] Memory/CPU Accounting in Slurm \u00b6 Memory Accounting in Slurm Summary you can use Slurm accounting to see memory and CPU usage of your program use sacct -j JOBID --format=JobID,MaxRSS to display the RSS usage of your program use sacct -j JOBID --format=Elapsed,AllocCPUs,TotalCPU to display information about CPU usage consider using the helpful script below to compute overallocated memory While Slurm runs your job, it collects information about the job such as the running time, exit status, and memory usage.

There is the infamous quote \"640KB ought ot be enough for anybody\" wrongly attribute to Bill Gates which refers to the fact that early computers could only address that amount of memory. In MS DOS, one had to use special libraries for a program to use more memory. Today, computers are very fast and memory is plentiful and people can (rightfully) forget about memory allocation ... as long as they don't use \"much\" memory by today's standards. The Linux operating system differentiates between the following types of memory: virtual memory size (vsize) , the amount of memory that a process (virtually) allocates, resident set size (rss) , the amount of memory actually used and currently in the computer's main memory, the swap memory usage , the amount of active memory that is not present in main memory but on the computer's disk, sometimes, the shared memory is also interesting, and it might be interesting to know about heap and stack size. Note that above we are talking about processes, not Slurm jobs yet. Let us look at this in detail: Each program uses some kind of memory management. For example, in C the malloc and free functions manually allocate and free memory while in Java, R, and Python, memory allocation and release is done automatically using a concept called garbage collection. Each program starts with a certain virtual memory size , that is the amount of memory it can address, say 128MB. When the program allocates memory, the memory allocation mechanism will check whether it has sufficient space left. If not, it will request an increase in virtual memory from the operating system, e.g., to 256MB. If this fails then the program can try to handle the error, e.g., terminate gracefully, but many programs will just panic and stop. Otherwise, the program will get access to more memory and happily continue to run. However, programs can allocate humonguous amounts of virtual memory and only use a little. Memory is organized in \"pages\" (classically these are 4096 bytes each, but can be larger using so-called \"huge page\" features). The operating system tracks which memory pages are actually used by a process. The total size of these pages is called the resident set size : the amount of memory that is actually currently used by a program. Programs can also mark pages as unused again, thus freeing resident memory and can also decrease their virtual memory. In some cases it is still interesting to use swap memory . Here, the contents of resident memory are copied to disk by the operating system. This process is completely transparent to the program; the data remains available at the original positions in the virtual memory ! However, accessing it will take some time as it must be read back into main memory from the disk. In this way, it was possible for a computer with 4MB of RAM and a disk of 100MB to run programs that used 8MB. Of course, this was only really useable for programs that ran in the background. One could really feel the latency if a graphical program was using swapped memory (you could actually hear the hard drive working). Today, swap storage is normally only relevant when put your computer into hibernation. Given the large main memory on the cluster nodes, their small local hard drives (just used for loading the operating system), and the extreme slowness involved in using swapped memory, the BIH HPC nodes have no swap memory allocated. Most HPC users will also use shared memory , at least implicitly. Whenever a program uses fork to create a subprocess (BTW, this is not a thread), the program can chose to \"copy\" its current address space. The second process then has access to the same memory than the parent process in a copy-on-write fashion. This allows, for example, pre-loading a database, and also allows the use of already loaded library code by the child process as well. If the child process writes to the copy-on-write memory of the parent, the relevant memory page will be copied and attributed to the child. Two or more processes can share the same memory explicitly. This is usually used for inter-process communication but the Bowtie program uses it for sharing the memory of indices. For example, the Python multiprocessing module will use this, including if you have two MPI processes running on the same host. Memory is also separated into segments, the most interesting ones are heap and stack memory. For compiled languages, memory can be allocated on either. For C, an int variable will be allocated on the stack. Every time you call a function, a stack frame is created in memory to hold the local variables and other information for the duration of the function execution. The stack thus grows through function calls made by your program and shrinks when the functions return. The stack size for a process is limited (by ulimit -s ) and a program that goes too deep (e.g., via infinite recursion) will be terminated by the operating system if it exceeds this limit. Again in C, int * ptr = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); will allocate memory for one variable (an integer pointer) on the stack and memory for 10 integers on the heap. When the function returns, the ptr variable on the stack will be freed but to free the array of integers, you'd have to call free(ptr) . If the memory is not freed then this constitutes a memory leak , but that is another topic. Other relevant segments are code , where the compiled code lives, and data , where static data such as strings displayed to the user are stored. As a side node, in interpreted languages such as R or Python, the code and data segments will refer to the code and data of Python while the actual program text will be on the heap.","title":"Technical Background"},{"location":"slurm/memory-allocation/#interlude-memory-in-java","text":"Memory in Java Summary set -XX:MaxHeapSize=<size> (e.g., <size>=2G ) for your program and only tune the other parameters if needed also consider the amount of memory that Java needs for heap management in your Slurm allocations Java's memory management provides for some interesting artifacts. When running simple Java programs, you will never run into this but if you need to use gigabytes of memory in Java then you will have to learn a bit about Java memory management. This is the case when running GATK programs, for example. As different operating systems handle memory management differently, the Java virtual machine does its own memory management to provide a consistent interface. The following three settings are important in governing memory usage of Java: -Xmx<size> / -XX:MaxHeapSize=<size> -- the maximal Java heap size -Xms<size> / -XX:InitialHeapSize=<size> -- the initial Java heap size -Xss<size> / -XX:ThreadStackSize=<size> -- maximal stack size available to a Java thread (e.g., the main thread) Above, <size> is a memory specification, either in bytes or with a suffix, e.g., 80M , or 1G . On startup, Java does roughly the following: Setup the core virtual machine, load libraries, etc. and allocate (vsize) consume (rss) memory on the OS (operating system) heap . Setup the Java heap allocate (vsize) and consume (rss) memory on the OS heap . In particular, Java will need to setup data structures for the memory management of each individual object. Run the program where Java data and Java threads will lead to memory allocation (vsize) and consumption (rss) of memory. Memory freed by the Java garbage collector can be re-used by other Java objects (rss remains the same) or be freed in the operating system (rss decreases). The Java VM program itself will also consume memory on the OS stack but that is negligible. Overall, the Java VM needs to store in main memory: The Java VM, program code, Java thread stacks etc. (very little memory). The Java heap (potentially a lot of memory). The Java heap management data structures (so-called \"off-heap\", but of course on the OS heap ) (potentially also considerable memory). In the BIH HPC context, the following is recommended to: Set the Java heap to an appropriate size (use trial-and-error to determine the correct size or look through internet forums). Only tune initial heap size in the case of performance issues (unlikely in batch processing). Only bump the stack size when problems occur. Consider \"off-heap\" memory when performing Slurm allocations.","title":"Interlude: Memory in Java"},{"location":"slurm/memory-allocation/#memory-allocation-in-slurm","text":"Memory Allocation in Slurm Summary most user will simply use --memory=<size> (e.g., <size>=3G ) to allocate memory per node both interactive srun and batch sbatch jobs are governed by Slurm memory allocation the sum of all memory of all processes started by your job may not exceed the job reservation. please don't over-allocate memory, see \"Memory Accounting in Slurm\" below for details Our Slurm configuration uses Linux cgroups to enforce a maximum amount of resident memory. You simply specify it using --memory=<size> in your srun and sbatch command. In the (rare) case that you provide more flexible number of threads (Slurm tasks) or GPUs, you could also look into --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu . The official Slurm sbatch manual is quite helpful, as is man sbatch on the cluster command line. Slurm (or rather Linux via cgroups) will track all memory started by all jobs by your process. If each process works independently (e.g., you put the output through a pipe prog1 | prog2 ) then the amount of memory consumed will at any given time be the sum of the RSS of both processes at that time . If your program uses fork , which uses memory in a copy-on-write fashion, the shared memory is of course only counted once. Note that Python's multiprocessing does not use copy on write: its data will be explicitly copied and consume additional memory. Refer to the Scipy/Numpy/Pandas etc. documentation on how to achieve parallelism without copying too much data. The amount of virtual memory that your program can reserve is only \"virtually\" unlimited (pun not intended). However, in practice, the operating system will not like you allocating more than physically available. If your program attempts to allocate more memory than requested via Slurm, your program will be killed. This is reported to you in the Slurm job output log as something like: slurmstepd: error: Detected 1 oom-kill event(s) in step <JOB ID>.batch cgroup. Some of your processes may have been killed by the cgroup out-of-memory handler.

For the Impatient \u00b6 Storage Locations \u00b6 Each user, group, and project directory consists of three locations (using /fast/users/muster_c as an example here): /fast/users/muster_c/work : Here, you put your large data that you need to keep. Note that there is no backup or snapshots going on. /fast/users/muster_c/scratch : Here, you put your large temporary files that you will delete after a short time anyway.

DO try to prefer creating fewer large files over many small files. DO NOT create multiple copies of large data. For sequencing data, in most cases you should not need more than raw times the size of the raw data (raw data + alignments + derived results). Introduction \u00b6 This document describes the third iteration of the file system structure on the BIH HPC cluster. This iteration was made necessary by problems with second iteration which worked well for about two years but is now reaching its limits. Organizational Entities \u00b6 There are the following three entities on the cluster: normal user accounts (\"natural people\") groups (Arbeitsgruppen) with on leader and an optional delegate projects with one owner and an optional delegate. Their purpose is described in the document \"User and Group Management\". Storage/Data Tiers \u00b6 The files fall into one of three categories: Home data are programs and scripts of which there is relatively few but which is long-lived and very important. Loss of home data requires to redo manual work (like programming). Work data is data of potential large size and has a medium life time and important. Examples are raw sequencing data and intermediate results that are to be kept (e.g., a final, sorted and indexed BAM file). Work data can time-consuming actions to be restored, such as downloading large amounts of data or time-consuming computation. Scratch data is data that is temporary by nature and has a short life-time only. Examples are temporary files (e.g., unsorted BAM files). Scratch data is created to be removed eventually. Snapshots, Backups, Archive \u00b6 A snapshot stores the state of a data volume at a given time. File systems like GPFS implement this in a copy-on-write manner, meaning that for a snapshot and the subsequent \"live\" state, only the differences in data need to be store.d Note that there is additional overhead in the meta data storage. A backup is a copy of a data set on another physical location, i.e., all data from a given date copied to another server. Backups are made regularly and only a small number of previous ones is usually kept. An archive is a single copy of a single state of a data set to be kept for a long time. Classically, archives are made by copying data to magnetic tape for long-term storage. Storage Locations \u00b6 This section describes the different storage locations and gives an overview of their properties. Home Directories \u00b6 Location /fast/{users,groups,projects}/<name> (except for work and scratch sub directories) the user, group, or project home directory meant for documents, scripts, and programs default quota for data: default soft quota of 1 GB, hard quota of 1.5 GB, grace period of 7 days quota can be increased on request with short reason statement default quota for metadata: 10k files soft, 12k files hard snapshots are regularly created, see Section \\ref{snapshot-details} nightly incremental backups are created, the last 5 are kept Long-term strategy: users are expected to manage data life time independently and use best practice for source code and document management best practice (e.g., use Git). When users/groups leave the organization or projects ends, they are expected to handle data storage and cleanup on their own. Responsibility to enforce this is with the leader of a user's group, the group leader, or the project owner, respectively. Work Directories \u00b6 Location /fast/{users,groups,projects}/<name>/work the user, group, or project work directory meant for larger data that is to be used for a longer time, e.g., raw data, final sorted BAM file default quota for data: default soft quota of 1 TB, hard quota of 1.1 TB, grace period of 7 days quota can be increased on request with short reason statement default quota for metadata: 2 Mfile soft, 2.2M files hard no snapshots, no backup Long-term strategy: When users/groups leave the organization or projects ends, they are expected to cleanup unneeded data on their own. HPC IT can provide archival services on request. Responsibility to enforce this is with the leader of a user's group, the group leader, or the project owner, respectively. Scratch Directories \u00b6 Location /fast/{users,groups,projects}/<name>/scratch the user, group, or project scratch directory files will be removed 2 weeks after their creation meant for temporary, potentially large data, e.g., intermediate unsorted or unmasked BAM files, data downloaded from the internet for trying out etc. default quota for data: default soft quota of 200TB, hard quota of 220TB, grace period of 7 days quota can be increased on request with short reason statement default quota for metadata: 2M files soft, 2.2M files hard no snapshots, no backup Long-term strategy: as data on this volume is not to be kept for longer than 2 weeks, the long term strategy is to delete all files. Snapshot Details \u00b6 Snapshots are made every 24 hours. Of these snapshots, the last 7 are kept, then one for each day. Backup Details \u00b6 Backups of the snapshots is made nightly. The backups of the last 7 days are kept. Archive Details \u00b6 BIH HPC IT has some space allocated on the MDC IT tape archive. User data can be put under archive after agreeing with head of HPC IT. The process is as describe in Section \\ref{sop-data-archival}. Technical Implementation \u00b6 As a quick (very) technical note: There exists a file system fast . This file system has three independent file sets home , work , scratch . On each of these file sets, there is a dependent file set for each user, group, and project below directories users , groups , and projects . home is also mounted as /fast_new/home and for each user, group, and project, the entry work links to the corresponding fileset in work , the same for scratch. Automatic file removal from scratch is implemented using GPFS ILM. Quotas are implemented on the file-set level.","title":"Storage Locations"},{"location":"storage/storage-locations/#storage-and-volumes-locations","text":"HPC 4 Research Only The following information is only valid for HPC 4 Research.
